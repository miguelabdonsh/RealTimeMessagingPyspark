"I had multiple boys try and touch me up or actually would assault me grabbing my chest, butt or hips. A certain boy would forcefully hug me and grab my butt but i couldn’t push away because he was a lot taller and bigger than me or he would pick me up and lift my skirt up flashing other boys. Other boys would put their hand on my chair when i was about to sit down without me noticing and would grab my butt or crotch area. My ex and his friends spread my nudes and showed lots of people and they would get set on group chats and even to people from other schools then someone used them as their own selling them and convinced people that their were their photos not mine and that i stole them from her. My ex’s friends also had snap accounts to get pics from younger girls and would share or sell them to other and normally older boys in the school. Lots of boys would rub up or touch me on the bus when it was really busy sometimes trying to get their hand up my shirt or under my blazer to touch my chest. Boys would verbally abuse me in lessons by always talking about my body particularly my boobs (bigger than the average teen girl) and would try and guess my bra/underwear colour and if they got it wrong they would stare at my chest or try and look under my skirt to see what colour my underwear was. Happened to lots of other girls but the school was blind or would do nothing about it. "

"When I was 8 I’d spend time at my best friends house. Her dad would often take us swimming. He insist on helping me to get dried after swimming, often concentrating on private areas saying ‘we don’t want you to get sore now do we’ 
I didn’t realise he was doing anything wrong until one day I felt him slip his fingers under the towel. I started having accidents and wetting myself, I’d be scared to be alone. I made excuses not to go to my friends house any more. Her dad traumatised me for life "
i was in class and he started to get really close to me he then touched my boob and i shouted to get all attention on me and it worked i then moved away and he got closer and closer to me as we went back to our desk he walked up behind me and grabbed my bum i was petrified. he moved his hand up my skirt and touched me i was stuck. i really didn’t think this could happen to me

i was at a party that was only sixth formers plus a few year 11s that had been invited especially including myself. i got pretty drunk and the music became too loud for me so i went in another room where there happened to be another person. he was a 17 year old y13 that i was friends with and i sat on the sofa with him. he then took advantage of me because i was so drunk and he fingered me and grabbed my breast so hard it was painful. he was holding it so tight i thought he was gonna break me. he then started to kiss me but eventually another girl walked in and he pushed me away and acted like nothing happened. i had to go back to the party acting like nothing happened but my chest was so red from him squeezing me it was obvious something had gone on. and the fact we’d walked out together. i had a bf and and he had a gf so he had gone and cheated on her and everyone made it out like i’d  cheated on my bf too but it wasn’t my fault. i lost so many friends cause of this.

"one of the teachers who has left, only recently though, used to flirt with me constantly and stare and me whenever i was jumping. "
"My neighbors cousin, male, 12, touched me inappropriately and tried to make out with 4 year old me. He said no one would see. Then, I was in third grade, there was a boy in my class. He would always touch girls inappropriately, talk about sex, and try to show other people pornography. The teachers mostly dismissed it, and his father excused his behavior. He groped me, tried to constantly chase me around, and even followed me me into the girls bathroom stall to try to see my privates. Then in 4th grade, puberty hit, and there were two boys who would make constant comments about my body. Bubble butt, your boobs look like implants, your so fat, etc. I got home everyday and sobbed to the point of nausea, and my father would say, “ They just like you.” Thankfully, my mother tried to console me, but I eventually would try to constantly work out and starve myself. In 5th grade, I got an online boyfriend. He made me feel safe, but even that was destroyed too, because he would show me lots of pornography and talk about it often with me, like it was a casual conversation. I became hypersexual and would constantly masturbate to the point of aching. I eventually broke up with him, and for some reason, I sometimes still miss him. Im 14 right now, wondering, still wondering why I had to go through these things."
"I was sitting in my maths lesson surrounded by boys in the seating plan and they would all make disgustingly sexual comments about me and talk about what they were going to do to me. After sitting in that lesson for 40 minutes I decided to get up and leave.

"On [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I was raped by a friend I knew for 3 years. He took everything from me. I went to stay the night with his aunt, she had dated my brother we were always really close, but I didn’t know he would be there. I figured it wasn’t a big deal he would leave when it was time to go to bed. I was wrong. I was laying on my side watching tv with him behind me. I get very antsy during movies or shows so I move a lot. That’s why I always felt like it was my fault. In my head if i had stayed still he wouldn’t have done anything. Fast forward [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I’m trying to go to sleep, he’s still behind me. I was moving around and he started moving his hand up my shirt and then down my pants. It happened so fast I couldn’t stop it. He then pulled my pants down and my underwear and put it in. It hurt. He didn’t have a condom on and I wasn’t on birth control so so I told him stop stop please I can’t get pregnant we need to stop. He didn’t stop. I lost a part of myself that night "

"When I was seven, the boys at my primary school would come into the girls bathroom and show me their private areas multiple times and force me to look at them. It was really bad because I didn’t get a choice and I thought it was normal. When I was eight I started getting hypersexual and watched sexual content. I didn’t understand it at the time. I would dream and fantasise about running away from school every day. When I was 9, my guy friends at my primary school would sexualise me nearly every sentence and “joke” about doing sexual things to me and me doing sexual things to other people. They would talk about sexual stuff every day and exposed me to everything. They made me watch sexual content as well. Throughout my life, as long as I could remember my dad would touch me sometimes and call it a joke. I never thought anything of it until I was 12 because I thought it was normal for everyone. I was always uncomfortable around my dad but I could never do anything about it. I also told him to stop everytime and sometimes screamed at him to stop but he never did. Even though it’s all sorted out now it’s still bad a very big impact on my life. "

I was 15 and I was trying to go to the bathroom. This boy from my class was in there and he pushed me into a stall. He shoved his hand into my mouth so hard I could taste blood. He forced me to stay quiet while he raped me and then went back to class. I told my teachers and the police but no one believed me because everyone likes him. This happened several times.

"I was sexually assaulted on a school trip to the movies. I reported it to admin, made a statement, and had two witness statements. They promised he’d never be near me again. The [date omitted to preserve anonymity], he was sitting across me on my table in class."
"I had recently started working out and I had developed a nice figure. One of the boys who I had previously rejected, made comments on my body everyday for weeks, catcalling, pointing, and giving disgusting compliments. It got to a point where he even touched me inappropriately, he would grab my ass or thighs. This day i was wearing leggings, this boy and his friends told me i was asking for it. I was alone in the hallway during class to get something from my locker and it so happened that he was also out of class. It was just the two of us in the hallway alone. He gets really close to me and subtly touches me, grabbing my wrist tight and telling me to come with him because he wants to show me something. I was scared but i was also scared to resist because he was popular and he had social power over me, not to mention physical strength. He took me outside behind a building, i was very scared and tried to turn away but at this point, we were completely out of sight from admin, students, and literally everyone as it was a very isolated area that is not used. He forced my hand onto his penis. He moved my hand up and down until he felt that wasn’t enough. He told me to suck it. I refused but he got violent and tried forcing my head down, raising his voice. He kept forcing and i couldn’t fight it anymore. He out powered me. He forced me to suck his dick; pushing my head down and pulling it up until he came. The entire time i cried and told him no, i begged him to let me go and to stop but he didn’t listen. Afterwards, I was too scared to tell people. He told his friends that I gave him a blowjob and a handjob willingly and they hyped him up for it and called me a slut. I didn’t think this would ever happen to me at school."

My freshmen year i was invited to skip and smoke with a junior at the time where he then handed me a different blunt then him and became flirty after a few minutes it then escalated to him trying to being my to apartments behind the school and was forcing me against the wall where i was being pushed down and had to run back to school
A student who would follow me to all my classes confessed feelings and would threaten me if i didn’t hang out with him tried pushing himself on me in one of the staircases 
"   When I was in fourth grade, I was scared shitless by my teacher. He never touched me, but he did make me shrink down to a girl who barely spoke, could barely meet anyone's eye, barely defend herself. Because of this, I was frozen in fear when my fellow classmate, around 9-10 years old, touched me inappropriately. 
   This is what people call COCSA -- Child On Child Sexual Assault. I want to believe he didn't know better at the time, but this boy was just like this. He was the big guy in my class -- the king of the room. So when he singled me out at lunch, when he slid over to where I sat, when he pressed up against me, I didn't think much of it. A [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I was remembering it, and with a start, I understood what it was, what it meant. What his hand on my upper thigh meant, what his intentional ignorance meant when I repeatedly begged him to stop, to get off. What it meant when I shrunk into my friend's side for protection. When she asked me to get off, and didn't think anything of it either, when she barely looked.
   I sincerely hope this boy is different now. I hope my teacher isn't still terrorizing kids, scarring their childhood in ways that stick with you for years. I hope my friend is doing alright, and hasn't had a similar experience of her own.
   Most of all, I hope that I get over this. I hope that, although my submission will be lost among thousands of others, it does something. I hope it gives me some sort of release, because God knows I need one.

All my love and hope,

"In elementary school I had a neighbor who was close to my age, his mom would watch our pets when we were gone and my parents thought the boy was just an innocent little kid. He tried to get me to do things with him at a young age and exposed me to things I didn't need to know about then. He flashed me and was able to get to my friend and she was traumatized. My parents still to this day have no idea and forced me to hang out with him because they thought I was being mean. He moved shortly after. He came back [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and tried to hang out with us again and tried to get my friend to come out, but she stayed in her house for about 30 minutes trying to work up to it. He destroyed our innocence. "

"I have another story, i was sexually assaulted 4 times by a boy who i didn’t even know and 3 boys from my high school. Unfortunately, i cannot name and shame these boys but it’s not as graphic as the last story dw. I was about 14-15 years old, [date omitted to preserve anonymity] years after my first sexual assault. I had my friends around me, teachers and adults serving lunch so you would assume that’s all the safety you need right? Well three popular boys got in the lunch line with me and my friend and decided that they would slap my ass and grab it. I told my friend immediately because i had been through this before and that she had a right to know because they were right behind her. I told her and then my other friend when i got to the table to eat.  No action was taken place because i understand this happens to most girls at my high school and the last thing i heard about sexual assault at my high school is that instead of boys apologising, the girl should for wasting staffs time and the boys learning. So really, where do you go for help?"

"I was hanging out with my friends. For a bit of pack story... im a friendly person. Im.a trans guy and i hug alot of people. I very much enjoy showing physical affection. 


So.

I never thought id feel so unsafe in a place ment to make me feel so welcome... [date omitted to preserve anonymity] after the incident he tried doing it again but i pushed him away and he could only manage to touch my chest. The school dont know. My parents do. I cant wait to leave school.

"the events that i am about to explain ruined my life. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i reported sexual harrassment to the school for this boy who had done it to multiple girls but i got told it was historical and there was no proof so they did nothing about it. i lost my virginity [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and i trusted the guy i did it with until the second time we had sex and he didn't even ask for consent and i didn't want to do it but he just did it anyway, i was too scared to say anything. another guy got me super drunk and i didn't want to do anything with him but he put me in a position where i felt like i couldn't say no i still have to see him from time to time and he's so horrible to me. in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i got high with this guy and when i got to his he said 'we're not going to have sex' and i was glad because i didn't want to. once the effects of being high kicked in he put his hands down my trousers and sexually assaulted me i told him to move his hand but he didn't listen. at the moment another guy is begging me for nudes and i straight up have said no to him but he keeps asking and saying 'maybe another time then' 'your loss' when i have said i don't want to and neither feel comfortable doing so. all this has made me attempt suicide numerous times, i'm afraid to leave my house i had to drop out of education. i want whoever is reading this to know your not alone and it's not your fault. consent needs to be educated and people need to realise unless someone verbally says yes you can't touch people. or even ask them to send photos to you. you have a right to say no, don't ever feel pressured to do something you don't want to do. you're allowed to not want to. stay safe and it's disgusting how frequently this happens."

"I was in my 10th grade year when this boy came up to me and asked me to go in his car and i said no. He physically picked me up and put me in his car. I was wearing a dress that day with nothing underneath and he put his hand on my thigh and he kept on moving up closer and I told him to stop but he didn't. I tried to move his hand but kept on trying to get in there. Then he tried to lift me up onto his lap and I pushed him back. He kept on trying to put me on his lap but I tried to get out of the car but he locked it so I couldn't get out. He forced me to get on his lap and he slammed my body onto him. He lifted up my shirt when I tried to stop him he slapped me. Then he left a mark on me. Then he raped me right there in his car and now everytime I see his car or a car that looks like his car, it brings back that bad memory when I think of it. This is sad I still remember that day and it still haunts me til this day of what happened to me that day. When I tried to tell someone, they didn't believe me that I was raped."

I was abused for about 2-2.5 years whilst at this secondary school. Some students were allowed into some of the classrooms during break and lunch without supervision which is how he got away with it for the most part.

"I’m including this in the hopes that others who attend or have attended the same school may feel less intimidated by what they call a family environment but what we all called a “cult”. It means nobody could speak up despite knowing what happened.


We had a gaggle of wealthy boys who created their own boys club. It was a game to them of how many girls they could tick off sexually assaulting without getting caught. I was an outside student and I didn’t know of any of this so when I was sexually assaulted under the guise of what I thought was initially a study session it completely wiped out my sense of safety, security, trust and identity. My academics plummeted and yet my Guidance teacher suggested I was making a big deal out of nothing, that it was boys being boys and that they couldn’t afford to lose their financial investment.  

I haven’t told anyone else about this, and I don’t know if I’m ready to tell anyone with my name but I appreciate this forum to hopefully allow and prevent others going through a similar experience, or feeling less trapped/unable to speak about it due to the unsupportive, cult like community of such a school.

one day i was in the back of a classroom and a student grabbed my ass. this same kid also walked by me one time and rubbed his hard dick against my back while he was walking by. he grabbed my shoulder when he did that. it was fully intentional. 
I was in a music class and a guy grabbed my head and shoved it into his crotch for minutes until another boy confronted him. I was 13 years old
"The first time i was sexually assaulted I was 12 on the bus on my way to school. I was sat by myself on the bottom deck, when a man came and sat next to me, I didn't think anything of it until I felt his had on my leg. He proceeded to move his hand further and further up my leg, I was wearing a skirt that day and had no tights or shorts on, so he was able to slide his hand into my underwear despite my efforts to remove his hand. I was young and not very strong, so I wasn't able to remove his hand. Its been 5 years, but I can still picture everything that happend that day, it gives my nightmares still. I just wish I was mature enough at the time to have gone to the police."
"I was in a group of friends with mostly boys, theses boys were heavily sexist, aggressive and some of them borderline abusive.

I was pushed against the wall he grabbed my boobs and continued to verbally abuse me. I still see him every day.

We were berated for speaking up and he's still there as a head of department getting away with this shit."
"It was the start of Year 7 and there was think autistic boy who sat next to me in most of my classes. He started growing feelings for me and started flirting with me. I said that I didn't like him back and so wanted him to stop. He didn't. It escalated even more to him coming up behind me to kiss and hug me. I told the school countless times about it but they said it was his way of making friends. He did not stop and it got even worse and he said he wanted to book a hotel room with me alone and do stuff to me. It was my last straw and I attempted suicide. This torture continued for almost a year. It shocks me that people excused his behaviour simply because he's autistic. Im autistic and know many other autistic people- we don't go around sexuallu assaulting or harassing people. In total, he has touched my breasts, waist and neck. Its luckily stopped but I am traumatised from this and am terrified of being anywhere near him."
"I was in 2Y and got sexually assulted by a guy in my class, while we were sat down on the floor and the teacher giving us instructions he would shuffle over and sit next to me to the  point he would be touching me and put his hand put my skirt and down my tights. He would then start touching me. I wouch be scared and didnt even know what to do. I thought it was okay and normal,till when I grew up i realised it wasnt. I never told anyone until now."
"This happened shortly after I turned 21.. I was with my boyfriend of 11 months.. We had recently gotten intimate with each other around this time. Usually it was consensual from both sides and everything was fine. On this particular occasion, it was not. I had spent the day at his due to family issues at my own home the night before, and was sleeping in his bed. Nothing out of the ordinary. I was woken up to him touching my body, and could see that he was satisfying his own urges without my consent. I was in shock, I didn’t know what to do as this was the man who I loved and seen as my safe space. I thought If I turned whilst pretending to still be asleep he’d stop. But he didn’t.. He lifted my shirt and rubbed his *thing* against me. I moved again and pushed him away. He then forcefully turned me, so I was on my back and proceeded to rape me. I tried pushing him off, but he was a lot stronger than me. I just remember lying there, crying. He just kept saying “I couldn’t help it, you know how I feel about you and what your body does to me”… Once he was done, he sat there with his head in his hands, and just kept apologising. I kept telling myself that he didn’t mean it (whilst it was happening), but his apologies after reaffirmed to me that he knew what he did and how wrong it was. 
Needless to say, I broke up with him on that day. I blocked him on everything. I couldn’t go to my local shopping area for 3 years after that because I was terrified of seeing him. This event caused me to severely self harm as well as even attempting suicide. I spent months sectioned for my own well-being and safety. I still attend therapy sessions to help me with this particular ordeal. It’s only now, after meeting my amazing fiancé that I’ve been brave enough to return to my local shopping area. If anything, now, I get a weird confidence boost when running into my rapist as I am doing far far better in life than he is. However, there are still days where my mind dwells on that terrible day and the questions and self doubt arise again. I should have just reported him.. but my fears about who’d believe me as well as everyone in my local area as well as my family then branding me a whore terrified me.. Don’t be like me, report it as soon as.."

"On a school trip for a week, I was the first child awake and was working on an activity book we had been given to complete during the trip, a teacher for year 5&6, put his hands through the neck of my T-shirt and began to massage my shoulders while stood behind me and then began to grope my developing breasts until he was disturbed by another teacher.
I remember trying to shrug him off but he was persistent and I was too embarrassed to tell him to leave me alone. He also used to make girls take off their underwear when we were getting changed for PE"

Im a survivor of [name omitted to preserve anonymity] 
I was out with a group of friends everyone went home but because of my toxic household I didn’t wanna go home yet and the Boy wanted to make sure I was “safe” and said we should go on a walk. So we did. Just to find out he didn’t wanna go on any walk a walk to a field where there was no one he pushed me aside and said I can never tell anyone what is about to happen, I started feeling scared and wait to go walk home. He grabbed me by the neck and started touching me. I said stop so many times I didn’t even think it was a real word at that point
I was then r@ped by him someone I trusted someone who wanted to make sure I was safe "
"I was in [location omitted to preserve anonymity]’s RC middle school, in year 6, 11 years old. There was a boy my age who had been repeatedly harassing me for weeks for the fun of his friendship group, saying inappropriate things loudly, I felt wildly uncomfortable about it and would always shrink into myself when he did this. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he sat next to me in class and started touching my leg rubbing up and down it, I froze and put my head on the desk he didn’t stop immediately. I did end up telling a teacher and he did stop after that. "
"I was 11 years old. 
My teacher took a liking to me, he was around 50. It started innocent and we found a few things in common however It turned dark quickly after our first meeting. He would follow me home offer me lifts home, take me out of lessons and have chats about kissing and what I was up to at the weekend. He would then touch me on the hand and whisper inappropriate things in my ear. 
And then I would be sexually assaulted shortly after that. The assaults happened constantly. I tried telling the deputy head teacher who was the head of safeguarding funnily enough and she told me she knew him personally and he would never do anything like that and I should be careful because my 'lies' can ruin his life. 
I am now 20 and it still haunts me. 
I'm still traumatised by him. "
I was at this point in time dating a girl about the same age as me and I went to meet up with her in the school we sat down talked for a bit and then she started to touch me sexually i remember the feeling of being highly uncomfortable even though she saw the look the look on my face she still did it on later in the day on the same day when I was walking with her to her house she then decided to keep bending over and feeling me even though she knew I wasn't comfortable with this 
"I got sexually assaulted twice in college, I told my safe guarding officer and she told my tutor at the time. She did nothing for me. Unfortunately I fell behind due to my anxiety and had to quit my course. I really wish I could have had that opportunity to finish my  course. But I had absolutely no support.
The 2 lads who sexually assaulted me got away with it and unfortunately I had to stop my education because of it.

"When I was 14, I was raped by a senior pupil. When I finally broke down and told a teacher I was taken to the head teacher and was suspended me for spreading “cruel rumours”. For years, I almost didn’t believe it myself as those who were meant to protect me didn’t. I was bullied, threatened and thought about taking my own life following this."
"[date omitted to preserve anonymity], me and my 'friend' were in a dance class. We had to do this move where you pull someone through your legs and she volunteered to be pulled up. As she was coming through, she decided to touch me where she was not welcome to do so. I told her that she couldn't do that and she denied ever doing it. She did it another few times and I didn't say anything, because I was too scared. At lunch, the same day, I went to tell a teacher, however they completely dismissed my claims, as we were both girls and 'it wouldn't be possible'. She went without any punishment."
I was 12 twelve at the time and a family friend 23 I think. We were sitting down outside a restaurant waiting for a table when I noticed the guy was staring at something I looked down to see my legs were slightly open I was wearing a shirt skirt and you could see my underwear. There were a couple table between us and he had been staring for a while. This made feel very uncomfortable but didn’t tell anyone later on in the evening  when we were leaving he tried something when no one was looking but I pushed him away.
"I have been wanting to share my story on here for a while now. I am now 23. This happened at my college when I was 17. I liked my college because I met my bestest friend there.  

There's always this one teacher that I had. One of my photography tutors. From the first day that I was in his class I could tell something was off about him. He was weird. A very bad off-putting weird. I couldn't put my finger on what it was, but I felt very uncomfortable around him always. Everyone in my class didn't really like him. They all thought he was weird. We only had his class one every week for the whole day. Classmates commented a lot about the teacher ""wanting to be my friend"" as he came up to me sometimes and seemed to have interest. not a big interest but it was noticeable that he would talk to me more often than other students in my class. I tried to keep my distance because I didn't want that. He was weird and I didn't like him. If you time when we went outside for the class. When the teacher of a talk to me he would be over me and standing so close when talking to me. so much so that his spit landed on my glasses. 

One day, he was going round the room at everyone's desk looking at our sketchbooks. he came and sat next to me like he did with everyone else. he was looking through and turning the pages. this was an A3 book, so it was big. as he turned the page and let it go Infront if me he grabbed my breast. touched and let it go. I was stunned. I couldn't talk i was frozen and staring at the wall. then he left. My mind was blank and just my conscience going around and around with ""did that just happen, what happened, what was that, is this real, am I’m imagining it, it can't be true, can't of happened, but it did, I felt it, I saw it, it was there, it happened."" I was shocked I don't remember anything after that. My brain was going round and round. I wasn't myself after that. 

I would take the train to college, and I only lived a 5-minute walk to the station from my home but I wouldn't walk. I wouldn't go. I dreaded the day that I had his lessons. I would hate going and would tell my mum that I don't want to go, and I don't like my teacher and express my feelings. it became the norm that my mum would drive me to the train station and see me off on the train, otherwise I wouldn't get on. I also stated to suffer with panic attacks after that day and no one knew what was wrong or why. I was still in two minds of what happened because it was a shock.  

[date omitted to preserve anonymity] two [date omitted to preserve anonymity] it happened again. The same method. Everything. no one saw because the desks all faced the wall around the room as we had computers.  this time after he left, I ran to the bathroom. this one was in the basement which is very quiet. There was no doubt this time what happened. the first time happed and this happened. but I didn't know what to do. I had the fake and fabricated guilt victims feel. Did I do something? no I know I didn't. it's not me. he just picked me. I went into a stall. They all had a big wide shelf, so I climbed on top of the loo seat and sat on the shelf.  I had with myself into a ball and cried. I cried so much and so hard that I fell asleep. This became a regular occurrence. I would leave the class a lot for a hour or few hours and sometimes longer. and cry in the bathroom and sleep. Because of the situation happened in the spring. I was in [location omitted to preserve anonymity] with my whole family to celebrate my grandma's birthday a [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. My grandmother and I shared a room, and I briefly told her what happened and that I didn't know what to do. I didn't tell her the whole details of everything I was upset. She said to me that I must tell my dad. I have to tell my dad. I keep this in my mind, and I agreed. And I know he would be one you would know what to do. I would cry myself to sleep most nights feels like every night. flashbacks. 

[date omitted to preserve anonymity] so [date omitted to preserve anonymity], [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. I went into my dad's room and woke him up and said please could we talk. I was already starting to cry as i sat at the end of his bed. I started talking to him about my teacher and that I've expressed how I am comfortable. Before I could say anymore my dad asked, ""Did he touch you?"" and I burst into uncontrollable crying and wailing. My dad held my hand as we sat together. He told me he will call the police. After I'd come down a bit that's exactly what we did. My dad sat down on the phone in the lounge, and this is a very clear picture to me in my memory. He says I want to report a crime. and he explains what happened as I am crying still. The whole time he held my hand. My dad was thankful that I told him. A policeman came round the in morning and they all went to the police station, and I gave my statement. I got a ride in a police car that was fun. It lightened my feelings a little. it was 4 hours giving my statement. I didn't have too late. It was all hands-on deck from that moment I arrived at the station. The police are very kind and good to me. My dad was with me in the room the whole time. 

From then on everything was moving forward with the police. My teacher was questioned. He didn't say anything. He remained silent throughout the whole interview I was told. This was very disheartening for me but again traditions in the fact that if someone else spoke out about him that there is someone else who has another story like mine. Together could do something more. As you can tell nothing is really done. There was no evidence no eyewitnesses, nothing. The police did as much as they legally could, and I appreciate how helpful and consistent they were with me.

I can't say the same for my college. [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity]. Not at all. I was mad at them for a long time. I felt so much anger. this s because I was called in because the college knew that my teacher was being questioned by the police and that he wasn't teaching at all because of this case. I was happy that I know, and I had to see him I'll be in his surroundings. Yeah, I'm speaking with the head of the college and as a person but also as a woman I thought she would be Open to hear my feelings. The opposite was the case I barely got a chance to talk the blame of the whole thing was put on me. The head of the coach didn't know the details but everything that is typically thought by victims and victim blaming that was put on me. Everything she told me was it was my fault and what could I do to make sure this didn't happen and there's nothing that because will do. Because you can't do anything because this is a college so I'm going to run into him, and we can't do anything about that. so basically, she said it's your fault suck it up. From that meeting I was upset, disheartened, broken. I felt everything was a lie. Everything I have been told in life to be safe with a lie. This college always advertised keeping this student safe and having availability and willing to provide safeguarding. I was offered no such thing. The whole experience I felt that everything in life that we told was rubbish. If I wanted to keep myself safe, I had to do things that I felt like it would keep me safe. My dad bought me a rape alarm and cans of spray that also dye the face. I started feeling that no matter what I'm a victim to anyone. And anyone anywhere can do anything. And that was scary, but I don't want to be scared my whole life because I want to live and find joy. I describe my experience as I had a flame in my heart because I did things that I loved my photography, and this experience got rid of that flame in my heart.  It took a piece of me, and I was missing that a long time, but it was gone. I started feeling that I can't be who I am. I can't be the same person who I've been. And that was a quiet girl who kept to herself. I was told that if you want this you don't get attention and you're safe. But that's the opposite. I started feeling that what I've been told to be like this my whole life from Society, was something to make me a target. 

I had quite a lot to go through. And I didn't have any therapy or counselling after experience because I didn't feel ready for it. I wasn't ready to talk about it wasn't ready to. And that's okay. You talk about things when you're ready to pick up with later I decided to use against me because I was starting to get flashbacks again and I realise it's time to talk to someone. It helps a lot. And I still have counselling to stay. Because it's good to keep on top of your mental health. Also, I did tell my family members after everything happened with the police and the teacher was no longer teaching at my college. My brother cried and he didn't understand why I'm crying, and I told him that I had already cried so much I couldn't anymore. My mum didn't give me much of reaction, but I explained to her that I need to know her thoughts and her feelings about what's happened, so I understand. I need to know that that's how I digest and understand things. It helps knowing what she thought of situations from a parental view. A little bit like reassurance you could say.  Also, Best friend and I were having a chat outside the cafeteria, and she saw our teacher. She said it's (Teacher’s name) and I immediately panicked and scooted back in my chair against the wall and it's all there so I can't go any further. And she asked if I was okay and what happened. So, I told her everything. And she said to me she knew something was up she just never knew how to ask what was wrong. She said she noticed one day I wasn't myself and I just carried on being like that and she thought it was odd but didn't know what to do or say about it. But I said to her I never want this to happen to you. Never ever. Talk to me if ever this happens and I am here and I will help you.

When I think about what happened to me, I want to help others. I want to encourage people to talk and speak out. I feel I'm not needs to be done for us survivors. When I was at the police giving a statement, he said that ""You're not a victim, You're a survivor."" I like to think about that. I also like to think that having this experience happened to me that it is horrible, and I don't want it happened to anyone, but that I am okay that it happened to me because I am strong enough to have done something about it and speak up. That if it happened to someone else, they may have not being strong enough and may be suffering in silence and maybe couldn't handle it and something worse could've happened to them. Thinking about the good that I've done even though it seems small It has a bigger picture to help fill. That flame in my heart that I used to have is Gone. That’s okay because I am a different person now. I have grown and have changed. I do things I want and enjoy, and I get confidence from them and that fills my heart. I am a better me and I am strong.

(although nobody else at the table seemed to notice, which looking back now seems rather odd), and he moved his hand, but he muttered something under his breath and was clearly rather angry that I stopped him from touching me.

"Something that I never told anyone has affected me all my life. I was in year 2 when it started.

I wonder and feel for the people who did those things to me however, because we were all so young, the behaviour must have been learned and it breaks my heart thinking that if I told someone, I could have helped a fellow classmate from being sexually abused. Aside from the anxiety from that, I feel like having such an early introduction to sexual acts has made me feel dirty, I can’t look at myself now in a mirror without feeling dirty. I feel so silly feeling this way but I don’t know how to tell someone or what I could even do to help myself. "

"Looking for a different environment to secondary where I had already been harrassed and assaulted by men, I was exposed to yet another man that would treat me like a piece of meat to be passed around, he gropes me and grabs me regularly and gaslights me about it and everyone in my class even though they say they believe me, are still friends with him and some have told me to just get over it and that’s it’s not that deep.

You act worse then any little girl I have known
Your arse is perfect 
Why do u sleep with women. Dicks are better want me to show you 
It got to the point that I constantly had my arse grabbed on my stairs so I would go to class late to avoid it. Or when I was bent over doing work all of a sudden there wasn’t enough space and a guy had to squeeze passed and press up again me. I spoke to many teacher about and all they said was well your all friends why does it matter and how [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I still get message from certain guys hitting on me.

"When I was 14, I considered this sixth former (17) to have been my best friend. 

At the time, I admit I was overly sexual - but no one really told me to act like a kid. I made advances towards him and he reciprocated. I was a naive child and he was a young adult who knew what he was doing and who with. I trusted him with my body because he was my best friend.

It was only until I reached 17 myself that I realised he had groomed me. I was not ready nor was I mature enough to allow myself to experience that. I regret deeply not waiting and rushing to do thinks with someone older than me.

I lied to the school and only told them the truth [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. I told them when he was 20, and messaged me (16 at the time) and asked to do more after years of no contact. I realised it was wrong."

"He was a boy in my class for four years he manipulated me into doing stuff with him and gaslighted me when I said he raped me I never told anyone so if you are reading this and you have a story you kept hidden away just know you are not alone and it wasn’t your fault 
I love yous all🤍"
"From halfway through the first term in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 10 at secondary school it began. We were friendly but not friends, we ran int he same circle and had the same classes but didn’t talk very much. He was the known bad boy, always getting in trouble, boys were scared of him so found it easier to be his friend.
 It started with the occasional sexual comment and then moved onto grabbing, touching and intruding my personal space. The sexual harassment went on for 10 months before I said anything and the only reason I did was because he tried to force himself on me in the PE store cupboard that I was getting equipment from. He followed me in, ripped off the lower half of my clothes and tried to r*pe me. He only stopped because he was startled by a teacher going into the office which was down the hall. I kicked him in the nuts, punched him in the nose and ran off crying. I finally told the school and my family everything that had been happening, spoke to the police and reported him. After I did a further 5 girls came forward saying he had touched been inappropriate with them. 
He was expelled just before our [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] year, it went to court for 3 out of the 6 cases and he got nothing… but worst than that he ruined my [date omitted to preserve anonymity] years at school, I became nervous and anxious everyday. I failed my exams and I started to mess around being stupid getting in trouble. He changed me for a long time. But now older and wiser I’ve got my [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity]’s doing a job I love, protecting and teaching young lives everyday. 
He may have changed who I was, & I grew up quicker than I should have but I have come out stronger and he will forever be on the sexual offenders register."
i was 13 and i was at the hospital. the doctor was behind me and examining my right arm (the broken one). he was asking me loads of questions and distracting me which is why i didn’t notice at first that he was touching my boobs inappropriately. i looked and then he immediately removed his hand. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i was leaving the room to get changed and he slapped my bum. i cried myself to sleep that night.

"When I was in [location omitted to preserve anonymity] school ([location omitted to preserve anonymity] I experienced numerous issues. I had boys sexualising me and trying to touch me inappropriately and without consent because of how my body looked. When I complained to staff I got told it was my fault for how the uniform fit me. Another issue I had here was a member of staff, he taught/teaches woodwork and he sexualised me constantly in his class and tried to embarrass me by saying he could tell what colour bra I was wearing. He once asked me to stay behind after class to talk to me about my work. He asked me to pick something up for him and started touching my thighs and said he wishes I was older. I felt silenced and didn’t know what to say. It made me realise nobody in that school was on my side and safe to say I never went to his class again."
When I first started secondary school I was shy and just wanted to feel like I fit in. I was part of a more “alternative scene” and tended to get on with older peers in school. I turned down sex with a [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 11 when I was in year 7 and was ridiculed and bullied for it. One of the year 10s then forced me to touch him and tormented me for a year until I moved schools and the school did nothing about it and simply said “boys will be boys”
My technology teacher started toutching me and my frien and played with our hair after saying stop and walking away he followed us and layed his hand on our bum

I was sexually assaulted and so were many of my peers by a group of boys here
"In the first/second [date omitted to preserve anonymity] of [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I was 13 at the time, I was walking home from school alone and a group of boys in the year above came running up behind me, I could hear them trying to talk to me about my stupid phone case & how it was nice and kept making me feel really uncomfortable and said I was rude for not talking to them, it was obvious i didn’t not want to interact with them but I replied and said thank you and kept my head facing forward, they obviously didn’t like this and I heard one say to the other I dare you to slap her ass, I sped up but so did they, I felt an attempt at lifting my skirt so I legged it, I could hear them laughing about the fact u was running and calling me names, I ran all the way home "
"he was my boyfriend, he took mr in as a friend after a rough breakup months prior after a while he asled me to send him stuff and sent it to his friends who told me, he then later raped me in my housr and his house and tried to in school, he repeatedly followed me and messaged my family even after our breakup "
"I was assaulted by a boy a few years older than me, he was the brother of one of my friends. It started out as him paying me attention and asking to hang out outside of school. I don’t remember a lot of it but it started when I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and got worse in secondary school, I was being bullied badly and he offered me a safe space and friendship. As I got older I realised other kids my age weren’t doing the same sorta stuff we were. I started to say no to the sex but this just annoyed him, when i started physically resisting he would hit me and hold me down, he would also put his hands around my neck tight til I couldn’t breathe. I passed out a couple of times but that never stopped him. Eventually my family noticed I wasn’t well mentally and I moved schools. I said it was because of the bullying, but i didn’t tell anyone what was actually happening "
i was raped in the bar on campus. told the [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] about it and they did absolutely nothing
"I was grabbed up in my school corridors and when i came forward to my head teacher, we went through all the kids i thought it could be and then when i couldn’t identify the person she sent me away with no help whatsoever. As well as that, a boy from my school who had been abusing me since the ages of about 6 or 7 was taken out of school after i came forward, however he is still allowed to stand outside the school and when i complained they warned but he still does it and it feels threatening and makes my day a lot harder. "
"I moved to this school start of [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and I made loads of mates but this guy always looked at me weird. He was in most of my classes and I felt very uncomfortable most of the time because he would do sexual stuff with his hands and he would say “that will be you in a few days” so I ignored him. We was in wood tech and it was only me and 2 other people plus that guy,he came up to me and grabbed my chest parts and I felt uncomfortable as I moved away he smacked my private part at the back and I just ran away. 
Another occasion is when I was in PE and I was wearing shorts, these 2 boys came up to me and started asking me questions. I just answered them when everyone went for break I stayed behind to get my coat but then two boys did as well. They came up to me and started touching me everywhere and I felt uncomfortable they would do sexual things to me and I started crying, I tried to push them off but I couldn’t after they finished they walked off and laughed at me while I was in the floor crying. Girls stay safe 
"
"In one lesson, I sat next to one of my (f13) friends (m14) for a whole year, we had fun and i guess flirted a little in a joking way, but he started touching me under the table, started as a hand on my thigh and then my bum and he thought it was hilarious tht no one noticed, and I guess I didn’t really know what to think of it the first time so i didn’t say anything, but it continued the rest of the school year, progressing to groping various other areas including my boobs and I was just stupid and thought because were friends it was nice to get the attention so I wore bright red underwear and wouldn’t say anything just let him do it because if i asked him to stop he thought I was joking. no one ever said anything and i couldn’t say anything about it but as it kept going i realised how uncomfortable it made me. it’s weird i feel like i should have known what to do. "
having a boy try to full blown rape me under the stairs by the changing rooms 
"I was around 12/13 years old when I fancied a boy in my class. We talked online outside of school and he asked for topless pictures of me. I sent the pictures. These were then shared through his friends and then throughout the school. It was a parent of another child who reported it to the school. I was put into isolation for the day, questioned by a male teacher and threatened with police involvement for soliciting child pornography. My nudes had gone all round the school, everyone was talking about it, and I was called names for a number of years afterwards. The boys who had shared the pictures had no negative consequences. I was embarrassed, suicidal, I self harmed for years after. I'm 25 now and sometimes I think back to this incident and still get upset. A [date omitted to preserve anonymity], in light of all the talk around revenge porn and these stories being talked about more openly, the boy, now man, I initially sent the pictures to reached out to me and apologised for what he had done way back then and it felt good to get some kind of closure.

"When I was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I was hanging out with some friends on the field outside at lunch, there was a lot of people around, even my boyfriend at the time. 
One of the boys in the year above me thought it would be hilarious to come and sit far too close next to me and put his arm around me, which in itself was fine and only made some people laugh, but then he started groping my chest in front of everyone but no one seemed to notice or care, and I just laughed because he wouldn’t stop and I thought if it was funny it wasn’t as bad. 
This was a minor incident compared to other ones at the same school."
"I met him outside. He asked : Can you help me ?
I helped him.
He invited me for tea at his home.
Because I knew him, I wasn't scared. [date omitted to preserve anonymity]...

I cried.
The case was closed [date omitted to preserve anonymity].

And [name omitted to preserve anonymity] [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] gives me a stage to share my story.

"I sat behind a boy in my science classes, I took triple science so I had at least two lessons in the same seating plan a day. It started with him making terrible sexual comments towards me, and then led to him staring at my crotch after pretending he dropped a pen and then to worse. I would crumble in my lessons, and multiple times I asked to go home because I couldn’t stand being at school. I came forward about it and the school went around asking everyone in my class whether they’d seen him do anything to me; I was then labelled a slag and a liar. The school wanted me to sit in a room with him and confront him with supervision but I couldn’t bring myself to do it, because of the severe name calling and lash outs I got from this I ended up in hospital a few months after coming forward about it. He continued to sexually harass and assault students with the school doing nothing about it (as his parents stated they didn’t believe those coming forward), instead of removing him from my classes I was put into isolation for ‘my own sake’ more like the schools way of going around it. I want anyone to know reading this, it’s not okay to be treated like this and please talk to anyone to ensure it is stopped before it worsens; I wish I came forward before it reached its worst. "
"It happened [date omitted to preserve anonymity] now and still haunts me to this day. Therapy hasn’t really helped and it’s the kind of thing that my body and mind will always remember. The boy was my boyfriend at the time and in the same year as me. He insisted on not using protection even though I repeatedly said no. He did it anyway. Then he left me by myself while he went to go find his friend. I didn’t have my phone so I couldn’t really see all that much. I had to stay with him for the night even after that. So I kept telling myself that because he loved me he didn’t mean it, but he broke up with me [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. He had put me through hell (physical abuse, manipulation and lies) for almost 8 months and ended breaking up with me after raping me. Everything kind of pieced together the months after he broke up with me.  But none of anything made sense. I haven’t recovered and I’m not sure I ever will. "
"I was mates with this one boy and I had been mates with him for a while when he started getting really flirty and touchy with me I never thought anything about it until he started saying the things he wanted to do to me and that’s where it got worse he was telling his mates the stuff he wanted to do to me and he sexually assaulted me many times through out the time I was friends with him the first couple times I didn’t think anything of it but when he carried on i knew that this wasn’t right and he wasn’t supposed to be doing all this I then stayed quiet for a year because I was scared if I told someone they wouldn’t believe me and I just wasn’t ready to tell anyone yet and after a year I finally told people and it felt better to have people there for me instead of having to go through everything alone and I’m glad I did because I finally had people to talk to I’m now in therapy to help with it all and I’m not better and I don’t think I ever will be better but it definitely helped by telling people 
"
"During school one day me and my male friend decided to skip lessons and sit in a grassy area covered with bushes. About half an hour into sitting and talking the conversation turned sexual, I tried to guide the conversation away from that but he began talking about how he and another girl had participated in rough sex and he bragged that he had bruised her thighs, chest, neck, and arms. I got really uncomfortable and even more so when he began to list things that he wanted to do to me in the bushes. I tried to leave and he pushed me to the ground and held me down, he unbuttoned my shirt and groped my chest while I cried. He started to try and undress me more but another person found us and I ran away, that person comforted me while I dressed myself again. If they didn’t find us I know I would have been raped. When I confided to my head of year about the situation she talked to that boy but told me there was nothing she could do as he “didn’t touch me in an inherently sexual way”. That boy then told his friends that I had hooked up with him in the bushes and I was  called a whore and a slag. The school did nothing to help me with the assault or bullying and even gave me a detention for skipping lessons. They didn’t even keep a record of it so when the situation was brought up to the police by another girl who was a victim of the boys my report couldn’t be used as evidence. I seriously thought of taking my own life during this time because I was harassed in and out of school and even followed home multiple times by this boys and his friends. If my friend hadn’t have found my note, I wouldn’t be alive to tell this story."
"When I was 11 years old, I was sexually assaulted by five 16 year old boys in a crowded lunch line at school. 
I was physically injured in an intimate area and I was absolutely terrified because they were older than me, bigger and stronger than me, and they outnumbered me. 
I spoke to staff about it when it was noted that I hadn't been eating at school- I was terrified of the lunch hall, and I wouldn't enter the line for fear I'd be trapped again. I didn't know their names and they didn't really have any distinguishing features. This was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] now, but I remember one member of staff asking me, an 11 year old, ""So what do you expect us to do about it?"". I was completely dismissed. 
This experience showed me that nobody cares about young women. Nobody even believed me because I was unattractive. I was 11 years old. My job was not to be sexually attractive, it was to go to school, learn, and eat my fucking lunch. 
Many things have happened to me since then. Reporting is feels futile. "
A female teacher touched me. I was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 8.
SA by my best friend when I was 8 even when I begged her to stop becuse it hurt
Sa by my best friend even when I begged her to stop
"my best friend did it over and over no matter how many times i told her to stop, each time she would guilt trip me and say things like “u don’t love me so i’ll leave”. i never wanted to stop being friends w her she was my person. but she left. what’s worse is the school didn’t help, rather they told me to shut up about it "
SA by my best friend when I was 8 she stripped me and used me for her own pleasure why I begged her to stop becuse it hurt
"I wasn't going through a good time in my life and drunk a lot to deal with it. This particular night I was speaking to a guy from my block who'd I'd been friendly with before. Idek how I ended up in his bed but I remember I was so drunk I felt paralysed and couldn't speak. He pulled my pants down and sexually assaulted me. I'm not sure how I did it but the feeling of his dick on my inner thigh was enough for my limbs to work enough for me to half crawl half stumble out of his room and into my flat. I made a lot of excuses in my head for that guy for a long time after the incident, telling myself maybe he was really drunk and it was a misunderstanding and that I shouldn't of gone to his room. But with a clearer mind I know he wasn't very drunk and having someone unresponsive and clearly very drunk on your bed is not an invitation to touch them. The reality and consequences of the incident didn't even hit me until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] when I went back for my second year at university and was touched up in a night club (something that unfortunately has happened to me many times in this setting). I have never felt such a strong negative emotion that has washed over my whole body in my life and the night of the incident came flooding back to me. I would often have phantom feelings of the guy touching me and regular panic attacks from that point on."
"I was groomed by a year eleven boy when I was only in year eight. He would always message me and tell me that he would “buy me stuff” and treat me “like a princess” in return for me being his girlfriend. I felt confused but happy that he was giving me all of his attention. There was another instance where another year eleven boy also grabbed me in the corridors to stop me from leaving him. He cornered me and always tormented me around the school for not wanting to date him. My school did nothing but warn the boy. My voice was never heard. To this day they still do not take anything serious and still expect victims to stay quiet and to not retaliate. If you retaliate, you’re problematic, if you stay quiet then you should’ve told them. Yet when you do try to speak out and ask for help, they ignore your pleas for help. "
"I was badly sexually assaulted by my classmate, and the school didn’t want to report it to the police because they didn’t want to potentially ruin his GCSE exams. My exams were taking place at the same time, I had to continue going to classes with him, and he continued to contact me after I reported it to my school. He was my friend and I trusted him."
It was my first week of secondary school and while I was walking home these older boys from my school were telling me and my friends they wanted to have sex with us and were offering to pay us for the sex. They were offering us £1 to suck them off ect. We were told not to tell anyone. Thankfully I told my mum but the school let them off with a “talk” which concluded with them being told to stay away from us which is hard to do in school. They never spoke to any of us about this situation.
"The first time was when a boy pulled down my skirt in front of my entire class, I couldn't even cry. I felt like I was meant to find it funny and that I was the joke.

The second time I was groped at school by someone I thought was a friend. He made it seem like it was normal, something friends can do then would talk about what he felt when he groped me.

I didn't realise why it made me feel so ashamed like it was what I deserved til [date omitted to preserve anonymity]."
"I was sexually assaulted in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] by a student at [location omitted to preserve anonymity], in my second year of university."
"In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I was sexually assaulted, harassed, manipulated and raped at my college. These events took place over a few weeks.
First, I think it's worth mentioning that my many of my teenage years were sheltered due to mental health issues, so I was definitely naive and didn't necessarily know how to handle myself. I believe the boy who assaulted me understood my vulnerability and I also believe he had a narcissistic personality.
He would make hurtful comments on my appearance, whilst somehow keeping a ""nice guy"" persona. He was quite forceful with me - especially when no one was around. I didn't think too much of it all to begin with; I told myself I was making things up.
If I said no to sex or sexual acts with him, he'd beg and wouldn't give up until I (barely) agreed. On one occasion he raped me. All I can remember from the moment was shock and disbelief. Again, I told myself I was wrong.
In the end, I realised it all. There was so much to process. I become extremely upset any time it crosses my mind.
Luckily, I managed to speak to my college. It took me a couple of weeks, but I spoke up. The boy was expelled. I involved the police as I started to imagine him doing something similar to another girl. He definitely would if he got the chance."
i was sexually assaulted by someone in my primary school aged 9. i wasn’t believed due to the condition they had and because they had a crush on me my whole school life i was always placed next to them to make them ‘more tolerable’. never was my mental health considered. it was happening daily for some time; fingers inside me under tables and i was frozen. holding my hand on school trips was seen as ‘just friendly’ by teachers so i was told to go along with it. it broke me. 
when i was in primary school this boy showed me his genitals and asked me to show his. i was only in year 2 so i didn’t understand what was going on but now i understand it was completely wrong
Got groped at the age of 7 on the playground by a lad in the year above while waiting for the rest of my class to be quiet enough to go inside for lunch. School only investigated bc my mum worked for them.
"When I was 13 an older boy at school started paying attention to me. All my friends told me that he had a reputation but I didn’t like listening to rumours and decided to judge him for myself. Before long we were in a relationship. He repeatedly SA’d me, twice in front of other people. He would emotionally and mentally manipulate and abuse me and controlled much of my social life. I lost my friends and had nowhere to turn. The first time he hit me was the day I ran away. After that he repeatedly tried to get into my house when my parents were at work and I was alone and would follow me home from school. He even threatened to commit suicide if I didn’t take him back. When I was 14 this had been going on for about 18 months, I met another older boy who I started dating just to keep the first one away from me. He also repeatedly SA’d me and lied to me about having a girlfriend, who later jumped me after school with her friends when he told her that I was coming on to him. Before that day I had never even heard her name. Later when I was 15 I got into my first long term relationship. He was amazing in comparison to my previous experiences but later went on to rape me. He stuck up for me at school when the truth with the first boy finally came out, and got in trouble for fighting. He felt I owed him something and took it in one of the toilets of the PE hall. I was a virgin before then. I was later diagnosed with PTSD and an ED from these events. Still to this day I’ve never told anyone all the details of any of these things and I’m now in my mid twenties "
"I was sexually assaulted by a boy in maths class who was sitting next to me, under the table. I kept trying to hit him under the table and begged the teacher to let me move but she refused. He did it twice."
I was sexually assaulted in highschool when i was 15 by another pupil during a science lesson. I went to the police & school. My case was dropped due to there not being enough evidence and the high-school decided that as he wasn’t charged with anything they couldn’t do anything. This meant they tried to force me back into lessons with him & to walk past him in corridors as if i wasn’t traumatised enough already. A few months of not being in school being too scared to leave my house and going into school only to be told they wouldn’t do anything left my mental health in ruins. I tried to take my life after this and ended up in hospital. Even after this the school wasn’t listening to me or trying to help me back into education. It took my mum contacting the local council & ofsted for them to take any action to help me back into school and lessons. It’s now [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and i’m still in therapy due to the assault and still can’t drive past my old school. It was the most scary time of my life i’ll never forget feeling so unsafe in the one place i was meant to always feel safe at. Wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. Thankyou for providing a place for victims too share their stories and for actively trying to educate schools & pupils & staff on this. 
I was sexually assaulted at the [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] in [location omitted to preserve anonymity] the day before my 13th birthday. I ended up having to move schools the bullying was so bad the head teacher blamed me and said I was “ruining the poor boy’s education” because I called the police. I suffered with panic attacks self harm and more because of the lack of support and the victim blaming I received. The school tried to refuse my transfer when they found out I was trying to change school until we threatened to go to news and everything (never would have) It was horrid I was 13 in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 8 and I had no one his family the school allowed to harass me as they would come into school and follow me around his cousins within the school would bully me constantly. 
"I had to sit next to him in a geography lesson and during the lesson he started masturbating.
Everyone except the teacher knew as it could be seen under the table. I wanted to leave but he was sat in the way and I felt trapped. This isn’t the first time he masturbated in class before the incident with me.
After the incident I tried to avoid him but he tried to be my friend after. I didn’t report it as everyone treated it like a ‘joke’ and other male students made threats of rape, [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I found out other students reported the incident but the school did nothing on the incident or behaviour after."
"I was 8 and in class doing a group activity. I can’t remember what it was but I was grouped with two boys. One of the boys asked me if I could keep a secret and proceeded to tell me he knew where I lived and that he was going to come round [date omitted to preserve anonymity] so that I could give him a blow job. I had no idea what a blow job was. He then went on to ask me what colour my genitalia were and what colour my nipples were and described to me in detail what his genitalia looked like and asked me if I think I could fit it all, and made a hand job motion at me before physically grabbing his own genitalia through his trousers and asking me if my parents would be home [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. I had no idea what he was talking about but I knew it made me uncomfortable and later asked a family member what a blow job was. On another occasion when I was 11 I was pinned to the floor by a different boy, had my shirt lifted up and my chest exposed, while another boy touched and punched me in the chest. I had bruises from how hard he hit me that lasted weeks. "
"When i was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i was chased around the field and even after screaming for help, no one helped me. 4 boys caught me and put their heads up my skirt. all i got in response was an apology letter the school wrote that the boys signed."
"When I was in year three, 2 boys - one in my year, the leader in the year above, convinced me to meet them in the toilets at lunchtime. They touched me inappropriately in sensitive areas. They forced me to touch them on their privates too. It was discovered by a teacher after around a few weeks to a month after it started."
"I was in someone else’s house home alone and I had invited over a boy I knew really well in primary school to then go and meet some friends for a reunion thing.
When he got there he was significantly taller than me and I knew it wasn’t going to end well. He made me take a couple shots and then led me upstairs where he made me take my bra off after he had taken out his penis claiming I had to now he had when I refused he forced it off and made me pose for him as he jerked off. Then he pulled my head to make me give him a BJ, when I refused he threatened to tell people weakness I had once admitted to him and he kept touching me as I tried to pull away. Eventually I pretended that someone I knew had just said they were five minutes away proving it with an old text. He continued to touch me everywhere and taking off my clothes but realised he was in danger and left. i hadn’t realised what had happened was bad I thought it was my fault for inviting him over and have continued to be scared of him since, then he told everyone at his school I was a slut and a whore."
"I do not wish to go into detail as this will be a public story. In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I was sexually harassed within college. it was public sexual harassment by a fellow student in block B with many students and even staff members watching this student sexually harass me and when i tried to get away he followed. It took several students intervening and even members of the community outside of the college to stop this student harassing me.
This student  groped me, 'humped' me and took every opportunity he could to touch my body in explicit places when i repetitively told him to stop and tried to get away.
myself and a [name omitted to preserve anonymity] reported it to the college and the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i was asked to come in and identify the student ( i did not even know his name) so they could report it. they reported it to the police who visited me, told me he had had a warning. i was told by several people it was not worth going further legally as this would ruin his life and future. because of this pressure from people i did not go any further legally. 
i still saw this student around the college campus until COVID-19 hit and the college went remote in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and he even attempted to approach me a couple times when i was within college halls. 
this had a massive impact on my mental health and i dropped out of college for two weeks [date omitted to preserve anonymity] the incident. "

I told a teacher and she did nothing."

"My friend well I thought he was my friend, who had been there for me for months, not trying anything. So I trusted him. I had been over to his and he had been over to mine where nothing had ever happened. One night when I wasn't feeling great mentally he offered me over which was normal within our friendship. We watched a movie and I started to feel better, it was late so I planned on leaving soon. When I got up to leave he grabbed my wrist and said you're not leaving until you have sex with me and I leave a mark. He was bigger than me and stronger so when I tried leaving he dragged me to the bed and forced himself on me. This experience has shaped my thoughts about university. Feeling good about starting and thinking that nothing like this would happen. Maybe I was nieve maybe I was stupid for trusting him. But these things should not happen to anyone let alone be done by someone you trust. "
Been multiple times I have been sexually harassed by two students at school. I felt very let down by here as I was getting heavily bullied and was experiencing sexual assault at the time. One of the student’s he would ask me if I would like cigarettes off him and to pay him back he would ask for sexual favours in return it made me feel really uncomfortable and I would refuse him. There was times when I walked to lessons he would touch me on my arse and try and put his hand up my thigh. The other student would send photos after school and because I rejected him he made everyone believe that I was a sex offender and I felt very upset because the school didn’t do anything about it.
"It was my second week of [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I was sat with a friend having lunch. She got up to go throw something in the bin whilst I stayed behind (which was fair enough), the second she left 2 boys that were in my year approached me with a group of their “older brothers and friends”. The older brothers (must have been at least 4/5 of them) approached me, groping my thigh and pulling on my school trousers telling me to “get them off babe” and that “they wanted me”. They grabbed and groped whilst I sat there frozen and being filmed (it was a brand new silver iphone 6 that i’ll never ever forget, they’d just been released and everyone wanted one). The second they let go I ran away crying, went home crying and told my dad who reported it to the school. The school investigated it, looked through apparent CCTV, made me pick out the boys from school photos and apparently confiscated the phone and looked through it. Nothing was found and i was tormented throughout the rest of high school and was even forced to sit next to one of the boys that was there and in my year, because we had to sit in register order and his surname happened to begin with the letter before mine. Nothing was ever done."
"When I was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity], there was this guy in my class who sat infront of me in maths, he always stared at my boobs since they are quite big.

He went to the bathroom straight after i did, he grabbed my boobs and tried pulling down my pants, im so lucky my bestfriend came in time.

My primary school never did anything about this"
"I was on a trampoline at a house party. I was cuddled up to one boy in my year group. He then began making gross comments about the size of my breasts. And said the things he would do to me. He then began un buttoned my shirt without consent, while another boy shined a torch on me breast exposing me to both of them. He then pinned my down and started moterboating me as I begged him to get off. I couldn’t move I was stuck underneath him. I tried to get away yet I was dragged back. The force in his actions left bruises all over me. During that exchange he also touched my vagina and carried on touching it. The complete fear I felt during this. There was many other people on that trampoline not one person helped me as they assumed I wanted it. I didn’t I repeatedly said ‘stop’ ‘please stop’ ‘get off me please’. They didn’t. Everyone was laughing at me. After years in therapy I feel ready to finally share my story. I was 12 years old. People still to this day don’t believe me and have said I was lying and took the side of the boys. I know what happened and the scars Carry til this day."
I was touched inappropriately in school by another student. 
"I had a boyfriend from this school, I didn’t go there but he did. We had known each other for a few years but started dating when  we were both 14. I had previously been raped by a girl at my school so I was quite nervous when it came to sex and often had flashbacks and moments where my mood completely changed. The first time this boy assaulted me we were having sex and I had one of these moments where my mood flipped and I asked him to stop. He didn’t stop. I asked 3 times. I tried to push him off of me but he wasn’t moving. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] a [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he stopped. He told me he was sorry and he didn’t know why he didn’t stop and it was just an accident. He told me I could tell all of my friends because it was truly “an accident” but I only told one or two people about it because I didn’t want my friends to hate him more than they already did. After this I genuinely believed it was just an accident. After 10 [date omitted to preserve anonymity] in the relationship, we broke up. I was heartbroken. I kept hoping he would come back to me, despite what he did. I believed my life was empty without him as I had nothing to do anymore. I lost all of my friends at the same time so the day he messaged me and wanted to meet up again I agreed. We both spoke about making things work again and I thought he meant it. He would treat me horribly at this time and I didn’t say anything because I thought I was lucky enough that he would give me a second chance. His 16th birthday came, [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. He planned that we would all go ice skating then back to his for a little party with a few drinks. I originally wasn’t even invited to this as he didn’t want me there because he valued his friends being happier more. In the morning I was dropped off at his house and gave him his presents. We had sex and then we left to go ice skating. In the queue he would tell me to stop being so clingy even though I was just stood next to him and only asked for a kiss once. He would say how were around his friends so we shouldn’t do that, despite having no issues with it in the past and despite his friends doing the same with their girlfriends. I was upset but shook it off. After a few hours in town we went back to his. His mum took us there. After all of the things I had been through in the [date omitted to preserve anonymity], like losing all of my friends, I wanted to get drunk, I wanted to forget it all and be able to relax for one night and let go of everything. I didn’t bring any alcohol so I drank someone else’s. The whole night is a blur to me, I remember falling backwards off his bed infront of all of his friends, I didn’t feel any pain so that’s how I knew I was drunk. The night is very patchy to me but I remember him taking me upstairs and holding my back all the way up his stairs to make sure I wouldn’t fall. The last thing I really remember is him locking the door to the bathroom with me sat on the bathroom floor. After that I remember bits of him telling people outside that I was crying so I was hiding in the bathroom with him. After this, I didn’t drink anymore and by the end of the night I remember feeling better. I remember leaving everyone else to go sit by myself as my own boyfriend was not even talking to me, leaving me to babysit his siblings as he did the whole [date omitted to preserve anonymity] prior. I remember he came in to look for me after a while and asked me if I remembered what happened earlier [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and I remember saying no to him. He then explained that when I was drunk we had sex. He joked about how I was better and we should do that more often. I asked my dad to pick me up after this and spent time thinking about what had happened. I saw this boy one more time when he asked me to come babysit his siblings. In the back of my head I knew what he had done but I loved his siblings and I didn’t want to leave them again, I also still didn’t hate him, a small part of me  still loved him. So I went. It was as usual, he paid me no attention and left me to babysit his siblings whilst he played with his friends online, getting frustrated when I asked him for help. After this day, I knew I didn’t want this relationship anymore. We began to argue and in this argument he told me I had “ruined his 16th birthday by getting too drunk and crying and making everything about me”. This angered me as I was too drunk for his birthday celebrations but it was okay when he wanted to rape me. After I had said this to him, he got mad. I blocked him and tried to not think about it anymore. It was over. That was until he started to spread that I had raped him and was falsely accusing him. I tried to defend myself but he was popular and I still had no friends. It didn’t work. Despite me having screenshots of him admitting to it, despite the screenshots of him continuously trying to get in contact with me [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. To this day people will try to tell me he is a good person. I hate it. I hate him."
"Gang rape, anal penetration. University offered no support. ([date omitted to preserve anonymity])"
I was at work [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and I was walking around and I got grabbed by one of the guys at that school and I told people about it and because there is no proof no one can do anything about it 
"MAY 09, 2023, AUSTRALIA"
"During my time at University, a guy offered to buy me a drink. It was my first one of the night, and I only remember about half an [date omitted to preserve anonymity] after that. 
I woke up having been spiked. My friends told me I was found in the toilets with my shorts around my ankles, covered in vomit and foaming at the mouth. [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity]'s ambulance wheeled me to nightlife where I was kept overnight with people who had drunk too much. I was dismissed as a ""drunk"", and the University took no action. 

I only had the one drink [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. I was not tipsy, let alone drunk."
I was stood in the playground with my friends when a boy I didn’t know came behind me and grabbed my chest from behind on another time he tried to kiss me and grabbed my bum. This happened on 4 occasions and the school did nothing. 
[location omitted to preserve anonymity] is the worst place ever. the PE teachers are nonces and stare at my bum everytime i have pe one of them even grabbed it! i feel so disgusted and i am too scared to tell anyone. 
"A boy sexually assaulted me in front of my entire class in primary school. A so called friend of mine pinned my arms behind my back to help him do it. No one did anything about it. I was told ""it's just what boys do when they like you."""
"I was sexually assaulted on two separate occasions whilst studying at [location omitted to preserve anonymity] [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] church. The first incident happened whilst I was out celebrating my friends birthday so we’d all been drinking and I drank quite a lot as I hadn’t been out in a few months so I wanted to enjoy myself. My friends eventually had to put me to bed as I was black out drunk and I remember falling asleep more or less instantly. I have no idea what time it was, but I remember being woken up because I could feel someone moving my body and touching me, but where I was still intoxicated I could barely open my eyes or lift my head, but I could feel that my trousers and underwear were gone even though I fell asleep fully clothed  and someone was in between my legs. I kept telling him to stop but he was much bigger than me, so I physically could not stop him. I wasn’t confident enough to the police even though the person who violated me was telling everyone what he did and told everyone it was consensual even though it wasn’t. The second incident involved a member of the security staff at the university who abused his power, this was reported to the police and he has since lost his security license but even with cctv evidence the police decided to drop the case."
When I was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 6 my friend at the time (fellow pupil) made me do things I didn’t want to do. He would pin me up against the wall and kiss me. He coerced me into doing stuff like showing him my genitals and rubbing up against his genitals. This went on until I left school. 
"In primary school a kid in the same [date omitted to preserve anonymity] as me would run after us girls pin our arms to our sides and shove his tongue in our mouth, he was pretty big for his age and strong, I’m sure teachers would’ve seen but nothing was ever done, probably because ‘kiss chase’ was a thing at the time which is wrong in itself. Throughout high school a number of things happened that looking back I now see were so wrong, but were kind of the norm. In year 8 a male PE teacher told the boys it was the girls turn to do the activity and they should stand back and look at our legs- that had nothing to do with what we were doing. Some boys felt it was ok to grope girls as we walked round school, one that stands out for me is when someone behind me groped my bum so hard that I could feel his fingers between my bum cheeks over my skirt, tights and knickers. A ‘friend’ of mine made a habit of pulling my skirt up in front of all our other friends as a ‘joke’, I would push him away etc, he used to tell people I was annoying. I sat next to a ‘popular’ boy in maths and he frequently rubbed and squeezed my upper thighs, the same person followed me part of the way home when I walked alone then pinned me against a wall because he wanted a cigarette  and thought I’d give him one if he kissed me. With a group of ‘friends’ we were all sat on grass leaning against each other, one of the boys rubbed his face on my vagina area over my trousers, I punched him then all my ‘friends’ said i shouldn’t have done that and I was lying just because he was one of their boyfriends. I had quite big boobs for my age and quite a lot of boys (and sometimes girls) took this as an invitation to grope them. Walking up the stairs someone behind me lifted my skirt up and rubbed my bum under it. I could honestly go on and on, I never said anything to anyone about these things because they were so normalised and happened so frequently. Although they’re nothing compared to a lot of the awful experiences others have had, [date omitted to preserve anonymity] they genuinely still play on my mind as a grown arse woman and they make me terrified for when my own daughters go to school."
"I was 5 and went to this nursery during the school holidays whilst my parents were working. They put children aged 3-12 in one area. An older boy with special needs was always there but he was a bit older than the others I think about 14. I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by this boy for that whole summer. They had this sensory room that was unsupervised where he'd touch me. He would also trap us inside the bike shed and touch and kiss me. Staff just laughed and thought it was cute that he finally had a friend and I was too quiet and shy to understand what was happening and say that I was scared of him and don't think I spoke to him once.
The moral of this story is to not let older kids that have already gone to high school and are a lot more mature, be around a much younger age group completely unsupervised. This experience has given me a lot of trauma to work through."
I was between 5 to 10 and my older cousin with autism would come into the room I was in when having a sleepover at my aunts and make me touch him. He also had the urge to touch me. This went on for years and I have not told any of my family because I’m too scared that they’ll think I’m lying. 
"Touched up constantly by a classmate in PE, I never said anything but always moved away.

When I told my boyfriend he said that it must've been an accident, and how could I be sure, instead of supporting me.

My sexual assult was spread as me and the boy ""having history"" and as consensual. when it wasn't. I still feel so humiliated."
"My second week at college where i was walking to the shops with my mates and these guys, one of them i was talking to and the other 2 were his mates, i wasn’t very fond of one of them as he is very nasty and aggressive towards girls as it is. So  we walked down got food and everything was fine, this then progressively got worse as we came back up to college where it was icy on the floor and i was walking up a ramp when the boys started throwing ice at me and my friend, one hit me in the neck and the other missed me. me and my friend kept walking when all of a sudden they run up behind me one chucks the ice down my back and the guy i was talking to put it down the front of my top and kept grabbing and touching my boobs this then made me feel really uncomfortable and i didn’t say anything till i got back to college when every had already known what had happened [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and this caused more issues. one ended up getting suspended while the other one was still in college and the 2 boys would still joke about it to this day. the worst part was the guy who i was talking to and was grabbing my boobs his bestmate videod it and put it on social media to humiliate me."
"one of my teachers would pay “special” attention to me and even though we didn’t have fixed seats, if i tried sitting anywhere near or speaking to any of the boys in the class he would freak out at me and tell me to stop flirting. everyone said it was just one of those weird teacher comments but it made me feel odd. 

on a non-school uniform me and my best friend wore the same outfit to his class but he told me to go and get my coat to cover up because it’s inappropriate. i didn’t say anything out of embarrassment but my friend pointed out that she was wearing the same thing, he just responded by telling us that my body was obviously more distracting. 

the next lesson we had was completely off curriculum, as he spent the whole time talking about the sexualisation of females in video game and anime as they have big boobs and revealing tops. at one point in the lesson he called me outside to ask me if the lesson was showing me how inappropriate my outfit looked to him in the previous lesson. 

i tired telling multiple female teachers who i trusted how uncomfortable he was making me feel over the course of that year but no one ever listened. he alway cornered me at the end of a lesson or pulled me outside and made weird comments that made me feel unsafe around him. a female teacher once saw him keeping me locked inside the classroom for a “breaktime detention” and came running over with a panicked look because they all knew he was a creep just didn’t want to intervene. 

he ended up getting fired over some inappropriate conduct between him and some girls on a school trip. he also happened to have a very strange relationship with a former student of his who looked very similar to me. "
"When I was in [location omitted to preserve anonymity], the group table I was sat at started bullying me due to being an easy target (I had little to no friends and was helping to care for my mentally ill mother at the time). Every day the group of 2 boys and a girl would mock and laugh at me until eventually the ring leader next to me, [name omitted to preserve anonymity], began touching and stroking my knees. I told them to stop but it encouraged him as the other 2 laughed. I told the teacher multiple times and begged to be moved but because the group would deny it and no one saw anything, I was never moved and told to put up with it as there was no proof and no one would swap seats with me. This escalated things further to [name omitted to preserve anonymity] stroking my leg every day and telling me I was a slut who liked it. Sadly I knew what that was at that age and my confidence and self esteem dropped. I felt dirty all for a joke.

At the Christmas season my pet rabbits had died, my uncle sadly passed away from liver failure, and my mothers mental health had deteriorated to the point that her alcoholism was more than anyone could bare. Understandably I was numb the day things reached it’s peak. [name omitted to preserve anonymity] was on and everyone was watching the film but I was staring into space due to all the negative things that had happened in recent months on top of the bullying. As I was sitting, I felt a hand go up my skirt and touch me which shocked me and I froze. When I looked at who did it it was [name omitted to preserve anonymity] with the biggest smile on his face, he removed his hand from my skirt and told me to keep quiet. Instead I got up (still in shock) and told my teacher like you were taught. The teacher reported it but [name omitted to preserve anonymity] only cared about reputation as it is one of the top public schools academically. I started self harming during the initial bullying by ripping the flesh of my feet to give me an excuse not to go.

I was sent to a councillor and given the doll to show where he touched me then told to attend counselling on how to deal with bullies. They told me to keep quiet about this and essentially blamed me. The teacher was moved out of my class as well, the one person who believed me. Nothing happened to [name omitted to preserve anonymity], instead he spread lies and his friends backed him up and I was bullied for [date omitted to preserve anonymity] after. I ended up leaving school at [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because the teachers kept sitting me next to [name omitted to preserve anonymity] who taunted me for years about getting away with it calling me crazy and delusional. I would try to make friends but people would say I was a crazy bitch who lied about being touched up by [name omitted to preserve anonymity] So I had no one.

The school never told my parents, only learning that after telling my parents myself years later resulting in my mother crying and begging for my forgiveness for not helping me.

This all happened when me and [name omitted to preserve anonymity] were 10 and I still can’t watch [name omitted to preserve anonymity] without breaking down."
i go to a pru so lots of people have anger problems but on my second week of starting at this school a boy in the year above me said that i’d taken his vape so he pinned me up against a wall and tried to find it ripping some of my clothes and then when he couldn’t find it held me by my throat and touched me while i was constantly telling him to stop i didn’t go back to school until he left 
"At senior school, there was a boy in my year who would often pay me a lot of attention. Sometimes he was overly nice to me, other times he would enjoy embarrassing me in front of his friends. I often stayed quiet because if I didn’t speak he would have no more ammunition on me. The thing he did the most that deeply affected me was that in class he would grope my bum under the table. Often he would just sit there with his hand on me while the teacher was teaching. I started by pushing him away and asking him to stop but as the teacher was speaking to class it was just bringing more attention on to me. Looking back, I should have spoke to the teacher and asked him to move my assigned seat away from him but I thought if I did the boy would find out. It got so bad that I would do anything to avoid this boy around school and would dread my favourite subject because I would have to sit next to him. In the end, it only stopped because I got a boyfriend and the boy said to me that he would stop doing out of respect for him. Thinking back this makes me so annoyed. He stopped because out of respect for his friend but not out of respect for my feelings. This stayed with me for years and I often thought that it was just a normal part of school. The girls at our senior school were always being inappropriately touched by other boys and it was just seen as them messing around and “boys being boys”. It is only now that I realise that this is classed as sexual harassment. I want girls out there to know that it is never your fault and it is not something that should be allowed. "
"One of my friends was harassed again and again by a boy in our year and every time we reported him “he’s leaving [date omitted to preserve anonymity]” it got to a point where he assaulted her and we go the same answer “he’s leaving”. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he’s still here, she is not."
"There was this boy. Everybody knew him everybody liked him. He was the type of kid to joke around and no one took him seriously. 

[date omitted to preserve anonymity] day I noticed he started to follow me around or that he was just appearing in the same places I was. Overtime it got less coincidental and more on purpose.

We take the same train to school so I knew that eventually he'd see me. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] day he came up to me and sat close. I asked him what he was doing and he said. Do u wanna play a game? I thought it was childish or gonna be truth or dare but I didn't say anything to him. He just got closer and closer until he started touching me. I know I should've moved I know I should've done something but my body froze and my voice was gone. He kept going over my body with him hands and went under my shirt. 

I after he stopped he left and told me that if I told anyone he'd kill me. I didn't know what to do. So I kept my mouth shut. It happened again later on.

I was going home on the train and he got onto my carriage. I sat my bag down next me. He looked at me smiled and grabbed my bag, he rushed down to the toilets. I wanted to let him go but I needed my bag. It had my purse, my train ticket and all of my books. I chased after him and I went directly to the toilets. As soon as I got inside I knew I had messed up. He was in the corner and he locked the door. I froze and the train started to move. He tried to lift up my skirt and turn me around but its like my joints locked because I felt stiff. Everything was going in slow motion. as I saw he was unzipping his pants I panicked. I slowly reached my arm to unlock the door. I felt more power and I pushed him off and hit him in the face. I left with my bag. As I was walking away a lady who saw me flustered asking me if I was okay. I wish I'd have said something. 

I told no one for 2 months and I'd stopped eating because I was constantly preoccupied with feeling guilty. After a while I told my friend who encouragedme to tell the school. My parents found out through them. The school told me to keep quiet. So I did, until one day I couldn't do it anymore I felt so used that I told a guy in my class in a moment of weakness. The [date omitted to preserve anonymity] it was all over the school.

One of the senior leadership team members took me out of form in the morning. She asked me why I told the guy. she said ""it seems to me like you told that guy so that the information would spread and you'd get attention. Why else would you have said anything."" 

That made me loose all faith in the school. Later on the boy who assaulted me admitted to that woman what he did and she relayed a message to me that he was sorry. When asked by the police and my parents if she'd write a statement she denied him admiting anything. "
"I reported being assaulted on campus at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] in [location omitted to preserve anonymity]. The student was a second year and I was in my first, I was told after that he had done similar things to someone during his first year which had also been reported to them and the police. He was suspended for only 2 weeks.

I left as the stress of the situation was too much for me, after which I found out another girl in my year had been raped but a different student. [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] unfortunately closes to cover these situations rather than punishing those who do wrong. "
"I attended a flat party once, everyone was in a random bedroom then moved to the living room. I decided to leave fairly early as I had an exam the [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I couldn’t find my phone so I went into the bedroom everyone was originally in and started looking for it there. I heard the bedroom door lock behind me and one of the guys there (I didn’t know him) tried to have sex with me, I begged him not to. Instead he held me down and inserted his fingers into me, I begged him to stop and he wouldn’t. 

I begged to leave afterwards but he refused to lock the door, I had to spend all night there. I thought he was going to kill me. 

After several hours I threatened to wet myself and he agreed to unlock his bedroom door. I bolted out his bedroom towards the main exit door, unlocked it and ran for my life. 

He caught up with me outside, grabbed me and told me if I ever told anyone he’d kill me. 

In the following months he stalked me, every time someone tagged me at a location online he would show up and I never said a word because I genuinely believed he would kill me. "
"I was having sex with a guy I went to uni with, it started getting rough and I asked him to stop. Instead, he took his condom off and carried on. He also took photos of me without my consent, he sent them to everyone in my course. I was so embarrassed but everyone said it was my fault for going home with him in the first place, a part of me still feels like it is. "
I was raped on school grounds behind an old building by another student and then shamed by teachers and other students for having sex. I was brought into a meeting with the boy sat next to me while the male teacher asked him all the questions of what happened. I told a female teacher I wanted to report it (it happened under a cctv camera) and I was told by her that camera didn't work and it would be my word against his. It was made very clear to me it wasn't a good idea to report it and thinking back I do think the school were just trying to cover it up.
"[date omitted to preserve anonymity] i was assaulted at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] , it was ongoing for weeks before i caught him. I would leave the classroom at the end of the day and the hallway would be empty, i’d feel what felt like a gust of wind on my bum. It would gradually get worse/more repetitive every Wednesday? of the week. until i spoke to friends about it and they told me to record behind me, so i did… and i caught him pinching my bum, the video was bad and the police couldn’t do anything about it as it didn’t show his face, but they helped me in other ways, the college did everything they could to separate us "
I was raped by my sports / housemaster from the age of 14 till the time I left my Boarding School ..resulted in a pregnancy an abortion and my life in tatters .. ran away from home at [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and finally at 55 I had a massive PTSD attack and remembered everything .. reported and investigation followed in total 132 cases from my school were taken to the police .. my abuser well he got 25 yrs
"Myself and multiple other girls have been sexually assaulted by a student that attended [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] from [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Reports were made about this student to the school but the victims were told to go to the police. I went to the police to report it so the school could do something about it, as they said they can only do something when the police get involved, and the school said it’s a he said she said situation despite me having 4 eye witnesses. The school then encouraged me to leave to “let him graduate so you’re both comfortable doing your studies without seeing one another”. Even the police were appalled with the way the school handled it. 

There has been multiple occasions of the school defending sexual Assaulters/ rapists. Even down to the security they hire at events, multiple times, a security guard has taken advantage of intoxicated students and the police were called to deal with it. "
"In my first year of uni I had joined a climbing sports club that climbed at an external venue. There was a member of this club who seemed okay to start of with but then after a month or 2 I attended a social one night a d we were playing pool. We ended up on the same team for one game and it started off innocently with a side hug here and there but then his hands would wander and start touching my private parts (mainly chest area) there were a lot of people around and I didn't feel comfortable, I started to avoid his hugs and stand on the opposite side of the pool table from him but after that night he kept messaging me weird sometimes sexual things then invited me to watch a movie in his flat. I didn't go but always wonder what could have happened if I did. I found out later that multiple members of the club had had similar and worse issues with him and he was known around the University for these kind of things. He still aprt of the uni even though clubs and individuals have made complaints and I'm terrified everytime I see him "
"At the age of 3/4, I was molested by a teaching assistant at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity], [location omitted to preserve anonymity]. I was the only Black boy in my school and the town so it made me a target. I didn't remember a lot of it but I would get flashbacks. My mum hid it from me when i should have received therapy for all those years. but now, after finding out at 22, I don't know how to feel because I'm not sure if I can be upset because it happened so long ago. I feel a bit lost"
"I’m just doing this to maybe give myself some peace of mind, so I can write it all down and let myself have peace from it.

I was 17, was at a military college ([organisation omitted to preserve anonymity]) and had met a man. He seemed like he wanted to know me, he asked for my number, was messaging me on social media, he showed interest in my interests. I had recently split up from my ex partner and had no idea I was also pregnant (I was roughly 15 weeks) during this time. I met this man, we went on a date.

I was sat in his car with him when all of a sudden he starts touching me inappropriately (I was wearing a scarf, as the weather was pretty cold) he started to pull my scarf behind the seat of the car & he held it there so he could strangle me whilst touching me inappropriately, I shouted multiple times for him to stop, he stopped for a brief moment, had pulled a gun out from under his seat and he’d locked the doors. At this point I was absolutely terrified, he was a completely different man to what I was shown previously… whilst strangling me, he held this gun to my throat saying things on the lines of “you’re going to give me what I want” etc… after about 2-3 minutes of this, he put that gun down and started touching again, that was the scariest moment of my entire life. It was either allow this to happen or he’s threatening my life so I had to allow him to r*pe me. When I left his car, I was disoriented, crying, in pain and scared. I had phoned my ex partner to explain what had happened however he didn’t believe me, nobody did. I tried going to the police… the closed the case as not enough evidence, when I gave literally everything (his photo, car reg & model, his name, asked them to check CCTV as surely it would’ve caught something) however they weren’t interested. To this day I still struggle to talk about how traumatic that night was, and I feel like I didn’t push the police hard enough. I’m really sorry for anyone else who has ever been through any kind of experience like this, I’m slowly putting it to rest… it took a long time for me to ever trust a man again, I still flinch whenever my current partner touches me (not inappropriately) but I’m learning to let it go [date omitted to preserve anonymity], trauma doesn’t define you.

"Got sexually assaulted by a group of boys at my school, the school then kicked me out instead of the boys because I apparently brought drama to the school. "
"I had just broken up with my boyfriend at the time, and I went to a person I thought was my friend and we went for a drive in his car. We went to [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] then to a local lookout spot to eat. I asked if he could take me home and he turned on his car and took me into the middle of nowhere and parked up. He proceeded to lock the car doors and pushed my car seat backwards. He pulled himself on top of me holding down my arms. He pulled off my underwear (I was wearing a skirt) and proceeded to rape me. Eventually he took me home and I went and cried in the shower. I had bruises on my arms from the sheer force he used to keep me still.  I never saw him again after this. I only ever told one person who knew him and they called me a liar. I was just about to turn 18 and go to university, I was that depressed I had planned my suicide once getting to university. I never did go through with it. "
"I was going through a pretty major mental health crisis at the age of 13 (pre an autism and adhd diagnosis) and getting badly bullied at the school I attended. I made some friends (or what I thought to be friends) at another school and decided I wanted to move to that school. I moved schools at 14 and started hanging round with my new ‘friends’, the ‘popular’ group of boys were a part of this friendship group and I was flattered when they wanted to spend more time with me, it started out that they’d invite me as the only girl to hang out with them when they went out etc. Then they started inviting me round when they were hanging out at each others houses and that’s when the assaults started, on multiple occasions I was pinned to the floor while they groped me, hit me, tried to take off my clothes and force me to kiss them, I eventually stopped hanging round with them but this happened 4-5 times before I stopped going round and throughout it all no one questioned it or thought it was strange, I only realised it was wrong at the age of like 16/17 but the boys all acted like it was normal, like nothing happened, and it severely impacted my mental health, self esteem and the way I allowed men to treat me in the following years. I have still not worked through all the trauma it caused and the knock on effects but it was just the culture within my school that made them seem to think it was ok. (I went to a well regarded school in my city, this was not some dodgy school, all of these boys were relatively well behaving high achievers in school)"
I was raped by a trans woman who I befriended on my first day of university in [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. It was a autistic students welcome week and I didn't think that would happen to me. I'm scared of talking about it because I don't want to spread the belief that trans women are dangerous but she definitely is.
When I was younger my  best friends older brother was always very odd around me however I didn’t  properly understand as I was only about 4 . One time he had some friends around and they asked me to lift up my shirt and pull down my trousers . Being young and naïve of course i obliged

It was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and it happened in English class the teacher went in to the class I was in and a boy who was bullying me at the time came up to me and pulled his penis out and shoved it into my face. I was 14 at the time."
"My best friend at the time someone I called my older brother and he called me his younger sister, sexually and physically abused me at school and out of school. He would choke me grope me and on one occasion made sexual threats towards my infant younger brother. I reported him to the police and for some reason all the people I considered close friends acted as if nothing happened and still spoke to him (even in front of me) the police gave him some form of community service for one of the instances. The school however did practically nothing. I was told to “ignore him” as he continued to try to intimidate me. He was in a majority of my classes (this was during gcse periods) and the school offered to have ME removed from classes and put into different classes which would add even more pressure to adjust to the other teachers so close to my exams. And putting more eyes onto me than there already was for randomly changing classes so close to exams. I was made to feel as if it was MY problem and was told “we aren’t going to be messing around chopping and changing” when I said I would try the changes of my classes as I was desperate to escape his constant harassment. I lost all my friends and was called a liar, which is absolutely ridiculous considering I loved him like “the older brother” I never had and felt I needed.  "
"when I was maybe around 6 or 7 my mums friends daughter who was maybe around 10 would always ask to play games like ‘doctors’ or ‘I’ll touch you somewhere and you have to guess where’ type of games where she would touch me on my v*gina and I just so cleary remember after school I was in her room and our mums were downstairs and she asked to play that game and i jsut remember her taking my tights off and doing it, and then my mum called me downstairs to go and my tights were off and i was so embarrassed even though I knew it was a game but I was just confused, I also remember when her and her family were round my house and everyone was in the garden and she took me upto my room and we were on my bed and she said she’d been learning sex education at school and she said that we need to kiss to practice for when we’re older, and we took our trousers off and practically ‘did it’ and even though I was confused and embarrassed I still didn’t really know what it meant even though it did make me feel uncomfortable, it happened a lot. and one thing I absolutely hate, when I was the same age one of my friends who was the same age as me stayed round my house for a sleepover i remember saying to her we need to kiss to practice because i thoght that we did:/ it makes me feel so guilty and it keeps me up at night."
my ex boyfriend assaulted me
"The guy i sat opposite to in college invited on a date, on the way back, on the train the pinned me to my seat, grabbed my face, groped me and tried to kiss me, i kept repeating the word no but he wouldn't stop, [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i reported the incident to my tutor, he did nothing. i was receiving threats from the guy and he would stare at me through out our classes, so i reported him to my tutor again, my tutor told me i was probably imagining it.

i was groomed and sexually assaulted by a teacher for a year.
"i was at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] in [location omitted to preserve anonymity] ([location omitted to preserve anonymity]) from around age 13 to age 16. during that time i attempted to end my life twice. not only were the teachers incredibly hell bent on drilling into me that i would never make it, the boys who attended the school were the some of the most cruel individuals i’ve ever come across. a boy called [name omitted to preserve anonymity] added me to group chat full of his friends and claimed he was “going to r*pe me” this was followed by his friends laughing and saying really terrible things- this message genuinely scared me because this group of boys (one of whom was my ex boyfriend) would stop me on school grounds and throw my books on the ground and touch my butt, corner me into a wall, get really close and shout sexual things at me. another instance was when a boy in my year punched my breast then later admitted it was because he “wanted to feel it”, another instance of this was when a sixth former took my pen from my blazer pocket and told me i had to kiss him to have it back, when i told him he could keep it he tried to kiss me- i ran away and hid in the toilets. there are countless other instances where i had been sexually harassed and assaulted in school and i emailed the school about these things after i left, i even included screenshots which i since deleted- i regret deleting them but after my school ignored me i felt nothing but shame, i felt like it was my fault. i didn’t deserve what happened to me in that school, i was treated sub human. so to all the teachers that made that possible this is my testimony- i am now 3 years at from becoming a doctor and a pillar in my community- you did not break me, sweeping my story under the rug won’t work anymore and you cannot just pretend these things don’t happen in your institution. do not send your children to [location omitted to preserve anonymity]  they will ruin your children’s mental health and their sense of self."
"I was really good friends with a boy I went to school with. We were that good of friends that he was even my prom date. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] day he called me and said he needed help because he was upset and having bad thoughts. I went to help him and he assaulted me. Touched me in places I said no too. Put things in places I didn’t want. He didn’t want to stop. He only stopped because two people came round the corner. Nobody did anything. No one believed me. He said he did it because “I showed him the wrong attention” during therapy I had to speak about it. I had to tell them the way he was with me the whole time I knew him and when I look back to my school life with him, he was exactly the same in school with me. Would slap my bum, grab my boobs. He even lifted my skirt once. the school did nothing and said “boys will be boys” maybe if they did something there and then and told him the seriousness of it, maybe it wouldn’t have happened. 
Still to this day I feel broken, ashamed, lonely. I still blame myself."
"I was coerced into sharing intimate photos online by a classmate, that same [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he cornered me in the toilets and groped me. I didn’t have the courage to speak out then so I’m speaking out now. "
I was sexually assaulted by a boy in my class: when I spoke up no one believed me. I left the school shortly after. 
"When I was 10 a new boy moved to my school, he was weird and people avoided him, many undiagnosed autistic afabs will relate to having to sit next to and befriend the weird slightly violent kid as I was forced to, we sat together in class, at lunch, and were forced to hang out at break, he became obsessed with me, he would follow me around, profess his love, and kiss me on the head and cheek, I joined lunch and after school clubs to avoid him (he lived kinda near me and would often catch me on the walk home) he started following me everywhere and multiple times asked my younger siblings where I was, they did not know what was happening but told me they had an off feeling and always sent him in the opposite direction. He started to become violent with other students when I was around causing the teachers to force us together more, I told every adult I could find what was happening and I got told he just liked me. He was never reprimanded for his obsessive and violent behaviour, the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] Christmas before school ended we (the graduating year 6 class) all sat at a long lunch table and had a Christmas dinner a teacher moved my chair to sit next to him so I was in the way of anyone walking past the table and also could not move away without being in someone else's space, I had long since stopped wearing skirts but it was a non school uniform day and I had just gotten a beautiful dress I wanted to wear, this boy kept touching my leg I told him to stop and I thought he had, when I wasn't looking he put his hand right up my skirt, I jumped up in surprise causing my chair to hit the legs of the teacher behind me, I tried explaining what happened but was yelled at for talking back, I got detention and missed out on the end of year party, I don't think he even remembers who I am"
I came to the school [date omitted to preserve anonymity] into [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I was told that several of the boys had all challenged each other to see who could “get” with me first. My first few days were spent being chased around the school playground being groped and shouted at by around 1/3 of the males in my year group. No teachers helped. Some girl friends and I were told we could not stay in the classroom during break for safety. I went on to further witness and receive sexual abuse from multiple boys throughout my time there. Many of which left physical trauma to the girls bodies and undoubtedly psychological scars. My worst memory is of a boy holding my head on the desk whilst pulling my toe under the desk strangling me. He would not stop unless I referred to him as “master”. I was told to stop messing around by my teacher. The school knew the threat this boy prosed to girls as he was caught many times by teachers and once by police. The girls were ultimately blamed and left to fend for themselves. 
"I was 13 when I was first assaulted by this boy. We then had a physical altercation at school, my teachers didn’t look into why. They just called me a problem child.
He went on to be my boyfriend who raped and abused me until I broke up with him at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. 

I’m 19 and still not free from him."
"I was sexually assaulted by a family member at an age I can’t even remember, multiple times. It made me hypersexual both as a child and adult, which got missed by my caregivers.  I sought validation from others, mostly men, and won affection through sexual behaviours. This often resulted in my boundaries being crossed, including one occasion where a male friend locked me in his house and pinned me down insisting I wanted to have sex with him, forcing himself onto me until I managed to get away and escape the house.

I eventually found a partner who latched onto my hypersexuality and began to abuse it. He relished in the fact I’d have sex at the drop of the hat, usually at least 2/3 times a day. While I have always remained highly sexual, my need to validate and constantly prove myself through sex drops off when I feel safe with someone. He didn’t take kindly to it as I started to assert my own boundaries. He’d beg me, start undressing me against my will, would expose himself without asking for my consent, put my hand around his genitals, keep me awake for hours against my will by pulling me about and pleading for sexual acts until I gave in, often many hours in. He’d bargain with me, eventually developing into the excuse of using the ‘bored & ignored’ kink to say I could even ‘be disinterested’ and that would get him off (which would never be enough as he’d inevitably start grabbing my hands or force himself into my mouth or inside me). Most nights I’d either wake up to him using whatever part of me he fancied to get himself off, or sometimes I’d wake up to him having ejaculated onto me and left it. I felt sickened and this just made the problem worse as I became repulsed by the idea of sex (with him - but at the time that meant everyone to me). Coupled with intense emotional and psychological abuse, this went on for years. It completely destroyed my relationship with my own body and my sense of self, took me years to find myself again and become confident in my ability to say no and to enjoy sex again. I’m still scared that he’s doing it to others to this day, and some people still tell me it wasn’t really assault or rape when I talk about it because it doesn’t sound like the ‘stranger down the alley’ story."
"There has been so many times I have felt uncomfortable around men since a young age ,When I was a around 10-11 my older brothers friend used to look after us he used to cuddle, stroke my hair sometimes he’d kiss my face and get me to touch him down below.
As a young adult/adult I have been subjected to men thinking they could grope and touch me in pubs and clubs are making me feel uncomfortable walking home on my own. 
When I was 18 a man decided he’d rape me in an alley way just up from my house and remember just worrying about what my mum would’ve said if she saw the scrapes and bruises on me. 
When I was 20 my boyfriend at the time was drunk and forced himself on me even when I told him I didn’t want to he told me it was my duty and held me down. 
I have had many men in relationships think that because I’m there partner I owe it to them I can’t tell you the amount of times i had sex when I haven’t actually wanted to keep the person happy. 
I know have messed up ways of love and use sex to gain the love and care I need "
"When I was in high school, there was a boy in a lower year and we became friends, he hanged out a couple of times and then he was asking for nudes. I kept saying no but I finally give in and sent a photo. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] when I was away for the weekend I got a message from someone in my year saying “ omg is this you hahahah “ and below it was THE picture. I literally wanted to curl up in a hole and stay there forever because I was terrified to go into school. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] comes about and I’m getting stares in the corridors. Everyone is laughing at this photos. Everyone’s talking about it. From someone who’s a shy girl  to this person that’s the gossip of the school was TERRIFYING and I honestly wanted to die. After a [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I got the courage to talk to one of the teachers, and they very supportive and was getting the name of the boy who originally had the photo and all the people (I knew) who had the photos and had to call the police. Couple of days after I went in a police station and spoke to a officer. The officers had all the names and everything and I only had to put a statement in and asked if I wanted to go to court and I said no, I just wanted it to be over and eventually everyone forgotten about it but me and now [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I still think about it from time to time and wish I handled the situation different but I can’t change the past.  I managed to push through the trauma because of the amazing friends and family I had to talk to and if i didn’t have that I don’t know what wouldn’t of happened but now I’ve moved on with my life. I am happy I have a boyfriend who loves me my life is amazing. If you are going through a similar situation. You are strong. You are brave. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. You’ve got this. Talk to your friends and family you might think that they don’t wanna hear it but they just want to be there for you because they love you . The main reason I told my story on here is that pain is temporary and happiness is just around the corner. Thank you "
I didn’t go to this university but the boy who did this to me did. I met him on a dating app and went over to his flat. I went with a couple of my friends and I got the idea it was more of a chilled party vibe rather than anything more. He then asked me to go to his room where I went with him where he proceeded to hurt me. I asked him to stop multiple times saying I was in pain but he didn’t. I formed an odd attachment to him as he was the second person I had been with and I didn’t process what had happened. He then assaulted me again and I knew it didn’t feel right so I blocked him.

I couldn’t hear his name without breaking down for months. But the worse times are when your at work or walking down the street and in the back of your head all you can think about it what happens if he walks thorough those doors, what happens if he walks round that corner what will you do. And then it’s the late night when you’re all alone and it’s on repeat in your head. When you start to doubt your mind if your remember it correctly, then the questions get worse what if I hadn’t had woken up what else could he have done to me?"

Luckily that stopped him long enough for the holidays to come around and the seating plan to be redone."
"I went to my bf’s house who was also in my class and he sexually assaulted me, everyone said I was over exaggerating since “your own bf can’t sa you” apparently but I didn’t want it, I never said yes, and the worst part was that his friend was there so I couldn’t say anything loud because he would hear."

"For 2 years a lad in the year above me kept trying to touch me and pull my hair used to always get his mates to sit behind me and next to me at the time the school had mixed form groups of one year and a year above. One day he decided at lunchtime to try and shove his finger up my bum whilst laughing with his mates at the time I was alone, cornered and felt so scared finally managed to tell a teacher and said they would look into it, told my family and went into school to demand to be moved out of the shared form room away from him and that we would be reporting to the police at what had been happening the school promised to do something about it but after moving forms he kept still pulling my hair and trying to touch me got to the point I was that scared and worried I made myself so I’ll to the point I hardly returned to school as they wouldn’t do anything about him. To this day it still scares me that he got away with it"
"He knew my breast size before my name. He called them 'the girls'. He was crude and his friends shrugged him off, applauding his bravado. At first I thought this was how guys spoke to girls, I thought this meant I was pretty enough. He'd catch me every now and then, talk about music, it all felt safe.

Then the texting started. He wanted pictures. Naked pictures. He'd spam my phone demanding them. Then he asked if I was dtf. I didn't know what it meant, so I googled it. He told me he'd make my vagina ache so much I wouldn't be able to walk. He kept saying things and then I got sick in my bedroom.

He backed me into the wall, only inches away from a class of year 7s or 8s, and touched my body and insisted on seeing my naked body. When it was done, he shrugged it off and laid his eyes on my friend, who had just come out of the bathroom.

He was done with me now.

The school knew about his reputation but kept him anyway because academically he would perform well. He did it to other girls too. Some younger. When I finally spoke up after my psychotic breakdown, it was too late and despite the school telling me he wouldn't be allowed to set foot on school property again, come results day, he got to collect his results on the school grounds."
"I was in my first year of university. He raped me. I didn't really understand it at the time and I blamed myself as I was so drunk and he told me again and again about how I 'led him on'. It is only now I know it was rape, and I still have flashbacks to it and nightmares about it: how I woke to him over me and tried to get him off. The awful thing is that he has passed away since and everyone was mourning and talking about how good he was and all I felt was relief and then so so much guilt for feeling that relief. And I could never say, because I don't want to ruin his memory and hiding that and hearing everyone talk about how good he was hurt so much. "

At this college I was sexually assaulted and once reported the college only told the boy that he wasn’t allowed to come near me.

"I personally have dealt with rape jokes and harassment on multiple occasions, an example being that I was told it didn’t matter whether I wanted to or not he’d shag me if he felt like it.

"when i was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i went to my friends halloween party. i got dressed up, i felt really pretty. my older sister bought me a bottle of echo falls and at first the party was fine. me and my friends were having fun and dancing and since i'm 15 and i don't drink, i got drunk fairly quick and i somehow ended up in the my friends bathroom with a boy i considered my friend. i was pushed against the door and was sexually assaulted. i couldn't even feel my legs or arms and i couldn't even push him away. i somehow ended up face down in the tub where he raped me. he threw my legs over the tub so it just looked like i fell asleep in the bath tub and turned the water on me. when my friend woke me up and said 'its time to go home', helped me out of the tub and had to go and get his coat from one of the rooms which had our shoes and coats and i just walked out of my friends house. with no phone, no shoes and no coat. it took me 4 hours to get home because i had no idea where i was. 

the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] at school, he had told everyone and everyone called me names. i told my tutor who took me to the deputy who blamed it on the wine and irresponsible behaviour. my mother blamed me. my whole family blamed me. 

im 22 now and i dont drink, i dont celebrate halloween. infact on halloween i turn the lights off and i cry because of that night and how horrific that was. i think the thing that hurt the most was the fact that my 'best' friend took his side over mine when i moved away to uni, i removed all of previous friends and i only speak to two of them and i was a fairly popular girl in school. i started again and i'm still learning to navigate through my trauma.

A boy i thought i was friends with began repeatedly trying to prove he was stronger than me and trying to get close to me and then I went on a school trip with him and he kept telling me he had condoms in his bag and he wanted to use them and then spent a whole day “accidentally” grabbing my ass and tits even after if told him repeatedly to stop until one of the boys in the group noticed and called him out on it and threatened him if he didn’t stop and then stayed with me for the rest of the week

I didn't want to, but they said if I didn't they would tell everyone I did anyway,  and if I did do it theyde keep it a secret and theyde like me more. So regrettably i did.
Afterwards they told all our friends in class saying things like I was hairy and a slag for doing it. It spread like wildfire round the school. Of course I just denied it but everyone taunted me for months. I wanted to die because of the bullying and name calling. In the end I had to change school because the bullying got so much I wanted to take my own life. "

"I don't even know if this is classed as sexual assault, my school wrote it off as ""boys being boys"". When I was probably around 7-8, one of the boys in my year, pulled down my skirt in the middle of the playground, in front of everyone. "
I was on the playground and an older student groped me. I was too scared to tell anyone. I was 6.
I was stood watching some classmates play football and out of nowhere a boy I was friends with ran over to me and started groping my chest. I felt so humiliated.
A family friends son I went to school with found me attractive. I did him as well but one day his cousin and him after school wanted to see my genitals because “they’d never seen a girls.” I stood there with my skirt up as they both stared and made comments about my vagina like “looks like a jam tart” and laughed. I felt so uncomfortable. I moved schools and didn’t see the same friend for years. The last time I saw him he SA’ed me in my sleep.

"A boy in the year above me at school started showing me attention, but only when no one else was around. He messaged me on Facebook, asked for my number and would message me a bit asking what I was doing after school.  He got the same bus home as me and started talking to me a bit when no one else was around. I thought he liked me, he would often say he did and at first I liked the attention and thought it was serious. He invited me to his Dad’s flat after school as his Dad would be home late from work and we could be alone. We started watching TV and he would touch and kiss me. I didn’t mind it at first but I was only 13 or so and looking back, had no idea what I was doing but I knew he had a reputation for dating other girls, being with them in many different capacities. We’d go into his room and he’d make me lay in bed next to him, kissing me and moving this on. I remember feeling uneasy but I wanted him to like me so much that I just went along with it. I literally didn’t know what I was doing but he’d say I can show you. Luckily I never had sex with him despite his various advances, but took part in oral sex. 

I told my friends a bit about it at the time and they made fun of me. Laughing and making jokes about what I had done, changing the lyrics in a song to our names and sexual activities. It was very painful and even now I get uncomfortable when people refer to that time in our lives and what we used to be like. I felt embarrassed, ashamed and it was worse as he’d never walk me out of the flats, just expect me to leave and would ignore me in public if he saw me and he was with any of his friends. It was awful and I’ve never spoken about it since then. It didn’t take place in school but this is the only place I’ve seen to post about it. 

I wish I had more support and guidance at this age. I wish someone had helped me understand what men actually want. I thought I was in control but really I was just being used and taken advantage of."
"I had met a friend through my workplace at the time, becoming good friends our work friend group went away for a weekend. We drank a lot and had been smoking some weed. I had tripped off drinking and smoking together and was completely out of it. I remember parts of the night but not like it is my memory but as if it was something I had watched. We got back to the hotel room that we where sharing with another of our friends. She fell straight asleep when we got back. I was also rapidly dosing off until I felt him getting closer and then it happened. I felt like I couldn’t say no because of the situation I thought maybe I had led him on in some way so I just lay there, still with my pyjamas on that he’d pulled aside. I thought there was nothing wrong with what had happened at first because I must’ve in some way been the reason it happened. But I wasn’t and I know that he was out of order now."
I was sexually assaulted by a male safeguarding officer at [location omitted to preserve anonymity in [location omitted to preserve anonymity]. A maths teacher also made me feel very uncomfortable and said that he had feelings towards me. I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] at the time. 
"I was 15 and I had just made friends with a boy he asked me to meet him so I did, he got me high pushed me to the floor and made me do things to him as I begged him to stop he was 18 and promised me he’d never hurt me the way I was hurt before but he was worse."

I got sa by my teacher. I was 9. He groped me repeatedly and always called me in for “chats” where he would say I was his favourite while he felt me up
my ex boyfriend when i was 15-18 always coerced me into having sex. There was one incident where i was extremely drunk at a party and pretty much passed out in a bedroom and he had sex with me. i didn’t even know that this happened until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] when someone mentioned how he was bragging about it to everyone straight after. I’m 21 now and it still makes me nauseous thinking about it.
I was sexually insulted in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] by my so called best friend when I was drunk.

"I was in the science labs and then a girl decided to come over and just sit on my lap, I pushed her off and she just laughed, [date omitted to preserve anonymity] her and her friend started grabbing my ass on the stairs and laughing about it "
"i was 8 when i was taken by another boy my age to a part of the playground where we couldn’t be seen, he repeatedly asked me to perform oral sex on him (i did not have full understand of what this was at this age, i just knew it was wrong) and i repeatedly told him i wasn’t going to. he then begged me to allow him to perform oral sex on me, i eventually allowed him to in order to try to get him to leave me alone as i saw it as the lesser of two evils. to this day i have serious sexual boundary issues and really struggle to say no, leading to me experiencing further assaults and rape when i was older. i am forever haunted by the thought that i was picked out by this boy because of a very obvious vulnerability as i was being abused at home, something that teachers at this school should have acted on in order to get me help. this could have been avoided. another pupil even found out about this incident and told a dinner lady, she went on to tell both me and this boy off, leaving me with deep-rooted guilt that has only subsided since i realised that this was in fact child on child sa. i hope this boy has also got the support he deserves as he most likely went through or experienced an assault as well and was acting out of that."

touched outside when everyone was coming out a boy came to me and started sexually assaulting me
"MAY 02, 2023, ENGLAND"
I was 13 my teacher took me into a room and started talking to me about my work then his had was places on my thigh and he started getting closer and closer at first I thought it was odd so I pushed his hand off and I told him can I go he said I’m not done talking and he placed his hand back I ran out the room crying everyone asked why I didn’t feel comfortable enough to say anything 
"When I was 14 I was groomed and sexually abused by an adult that was a close family friend. looking back, I realised that in school I showed clear signs of abuse. I went from chatty, and lively, being the class clown to like a zombie, withdrawn and depressed. I used to go home with “tummy aches” multiple times a week and remember trying to signal to staff that I needed help but no one paid attention. There was a complete lack of safeguarding in my school, they mostly wanted to stay as far away from the issue of sexual abuse as they could because it was a catholic school. It has since closed down because of its outdated way of running/its views. I feel like I will never get closure or recognition for just how much that school failed to protect me and many other students."
I was spiked and sexually assaulted by an older man. I don’t remember any of it 
"A female student in my year and many of my classes kept grabbing and slapping my backside and was told to stop by me and other students who witnessed it. the girl still carried on so i decided to tell a head of year and he smirked and said ""im not your head of your, tell your head of year if its really concerning you"" and also a female student touched and harrassed another male student and when he reported her he was told that "" he probably led her on"" why is it that when a male student is being sexually assulted or harrassed the teachers dont take any notice or issue any consequences however when it happens to a female they do something about it. im not saying that they should turn a blind eye to females being sexually harrassed aswell but im saying to treat the reports with the same consequences and the same investigation."
"Hi, I’m a 16 year old girl who has suffered from rape not from the school but from one of my family members I was 5 years old when it started and it stopped when I had moved but I had only realised that this happened to me in the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] maybe. I had told a counsellor at my school and she just said “your overthinking things” but I had reported it and I’m doing better now. "
"a year 11, i am year 10, was begging me to have sex with him for days on end and when i went to meet him when i said i wasn’t having sex with him we ended up doing it because he kept asking and i gave in and said yes, when i asked him to stop about 2-3 times he wouldn’t stop he just kept asking me to let him finish and i didn’t know it was rape until everyone told me it was "
"I was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 7 and having moved from a very small primary school I hadn’t had many interactions with boys, especially in a “non friend way”. This one particular boy showed a lot of interest in me since the beginning of [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 7 and would always compliment me which made me feel good. Anyway he was in a few of my lessons and I always sat next to him, he would always be very touchy and grabby with me and it made me very uncomfortable and confused(considering I hadn’t even kissed a boy yet) I remember he would pressure me in drama to follow him behind the curtain, I thought maybe he wanted to kiss me which made me feel excited but no instead he would grab and slap me in places I really didn’t want to be grabbed or slapped. I never reported it because I guess I didn’t properly understand what was even happening at the time. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] this had stopped and we became good friends and unfortunately I had “forgotten” about it all and developed a crush on him. When I was 13 he pressured me into sending nudes to him and said if I didn’t we cannot be friends or more than friends,  so being a young naive girl I thought there wasn’t much harm in it, I was clearly wrong . He didn’t hesitate to send them to all mine and his friends at the time- to this day I think it’s still one of the most traumatic things I’ve ever gone through- the school found out because he sold them to some boys 2 years above me and got caught, thankfully, the police were contacted but he was too young to receive much punishment for it. He was still kept in all of my lessons, and it used to make me so angry and scared being in the same room as him. I really hope whoever reads this decides to speak up if you’ve gone through anything like this. "
I was at a party with my boyfriend at the time. He asked me to have sex woth him in a spare room. I said no as i didn’t feel comfortable but he forced himself into me and did it anways.
"While walking home alone, a group of boys from my school approached me. One of them grabbed me and began touching me inappropriately, while another covered my mouth to prevent me from screaming. The assault was over quickly, and the boys left me traumatised on the ground. I struggled to cope with the trauma and shame of the assault, but with the support of my family and friends. I reported the assault to my parents and the police, but found it difficult to talk about what had happened. I had to take a break from school, but eventually returned and continued my studies. The boys who assaulted me were caught and punished, but the experience left a lasting impact on me. I now know that sexual assault can happen to anyone, anywhere, and I hope that every can share their own experience."
I was in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] about [date omitted to preserve anonymity] at the time. my teacher started favouriting me and i thought it was because i was smart. turns out he just wanted to gain my trust. asked me to get tutored by him and go to him at breaks and lunches. he started touching me and saying if i told anyone i would be kicked out the school. not wanting to leave my best friends I kept quiet and then left to go to high school [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Im 27 now and want teachers to understand they cant use power to manipulate children.
"Back in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I was a p6 student at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] primary [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity], whilst attending a school dance in the gym I went to the girls changing room to get some space and cool down, I was alone until a boy came in and proceeded to forcefully lift my top and grab my breasts quickly while laughing,  a teacher walked passed just as he stood back and I was able to pull my top down. With a bright red face and tears barely held back I heard that teacher give us both in trouble for messing around and before I could actually explain what happened we were told to get back out to the hall. "
he added me on [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] after i spoke to him a few times in class and tried to force me to send stuff and asked me personal questions and then told everyone i was his girlfriend and tried to get me to suck his dick and have sex wirh him and when i would say no he would threaten me so i blocked him on everything and he spread rumours telling everyone i was a slag and i was setting up to have sex with him
"i went to [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] through the whole of secondary. when i was in year 10 at aged 15 k was sexually assaulted by the ‘new girl’. me and my group of friends found out that she went to our school and we wanted to be her friend. At first she seemed a bit off, but we didn’t do anything because we throughly she was just new and a bit scared or something. one day when we were alone in the playground she pushed me up against the gate infront of a whole playground of people and touched me. I told her multiple times that i didnt like it and it made me uncomfy and she said ‘you do’. i left feelinf violated and my friends all reported it to our teacher. they made me sit in the same room as her and said ‘she said that you were questioning your sexuality and that you liked it’ and made me apologise to the girl. "
"Boy in the year above me was my boyfriend, he took advantage of that. I was 13."
"Happened in [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I was in class, I was sat near my friend. I was talking to her, this boy next to her starts doing a sexual hand gesture of like hj. We didn't have cameras in classrooms yet. I kept inside of me till [date omitted to preserve anonymity] or [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Told my teacher, he told behavioural staff and I had to file a report then later, I got a restraining order. It still happened."
"From the age of 6-8 I was sexually assaulted by a boy who lived up the road from me he was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 12 when it started. Although I have later found out that he has mental disabilities it doesn’t excuse the trauma he put me through. I dont remember much at all of those 2 years of my life because since realising what he did me I’ve blocked the whole time period out of my mind, but the things he did I will never forget. I was young, I didn’t know what he was doing when he would touch me or make me touch him and do things to him, but I knew it was wrong. Our street was filled with kids and we would always play together in the street so it was unusual for two kids with such an age gap to be together, the first time it happened I just remember going back to his house with him thinking we were going to play. He took me to his room and took his trousers down and made me do things to do him I can’t ever forget. I didn’t realise how bad this was until I was around 13 and at that point it broke me when I realised what he had done. Ever since then I’ve been different. I’ve had many more encounters of sexual assault, abuse and I was raped but still to me this was the worst. He took my innocence from me. I became hyper sexually actively as soon as I got to high school even before because he made me think it was normal. I was exposed to such things at a horrifyingly young age and it is something I will never be able to forget. "

a classroom assistant was helping me with my work in maths and when no one was looking reached over my shoulder and touched my breasts i spoke to the head teacher of that school about it and he did nothing saying there was no proof when 3 other people saw what had happened and another girl in my head had reported something similar

"When I was at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] I was constantly physically abused by teachers, they would grab me and pick me up restrain me all because I'm autistic with ADHD, I was even hit a few times by teachers I ended up sending one of them to hospital in self defense, I was locked in a tiny room for several hours between the exit door and the exit door just before. They told me I was crying like a baby but it was my coping skill, Onto the topic of royal harbour, I was attacked by several kids, hit in the head until I almost passed out booted and kicked, I was too vulnerable to do anything so they simply continued hitting me."
I was sexually assaulted [date omitted to preserve anonymity] when by another pupil they would put there hand up my skirt any time I passed them and it went on for about 3-4 months.

"I was dating a lad I met of a friend (never met him) and at the start he was very nice and loving. Always caree about what I had to say and my opinions. Then around 2-3 weeks into the relationship he started to act weird. Causing aurgements over having boy mates, saying hi to a boy. Literally the smallest things ever. He started sending me pictures of knives and threatening me with them. Then one day we had a really bad aurgement over a boy making me uncomfortable. He started getting really mad calling me names, showing my knives, telling me to shut up or fuck off. I left him alone for abit to cool off, then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I got a text from him saying ""im so sorry about what happened babe. To make it up to you. Ill come meet you."" I was suspicious but forgot about it soon. I met him at a local shop near my house. I saw him, I ran up to him and went to hug him. Then I realised he had a knife in  his hand. He pressed it up against my back and said ""better fucking behave"" I immediately froze. I was terrified. We got on a bus back to his house it was a large house but not very large. His room was painted a beige colour and he had a desk next to his bed and a window. He pushed me up against thr bed. Pinned my hands above my head against the wall. N started taking our clothes off. I started kicking. Really hard. And he got more and more pissed and proceeded to molest me. I can remember a pain in my stomach and back. And can remember blood everywhere. I cried. And cried. And cried. He held me and fell asleep when he was done. I manged to get off him without waking him up and jumping out the window. I still had like 20 quid on me so I ran to the bus stop n caught a bus back home."

"when i reported my assault to my school after an extremely triggering “sexual assault awareness assembly”,  i was told by the “safeguarding” team that it would be dealt with , i wouldn’t be blamed and that they would do something about it. none of the above happened. i was told that both me and the perpetrator of my assault had “lessons to learn” , i was told to “go home put my pajamas on and watch a chick flick” to feel better and this boy is still in the school. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i was told to “stop gossiping” about him as it has a “bad reprimand” on him, simply for telling my story. he still walks through the school building an innocent man as if he didn’t damage me permanently, and this is purely because the school showed him no consequences .

at school i got pulled into a cupboard and pushed in to a wall i was physically touched and was really uncomfortable the person who did that has now left but i’ve never really talked about it people don’t realise how badly it affects someone 
"I don't know if this was proper assault but I'm still I'm still gonna say it one day in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] seven I was walking up to my class when one of my teachers looked up a girls skirt I never thought it would happen to me untill a [date omitted to preserve anonymity] in year 7 still I was walking up the stairs and had a gut feeling something was wrong I turned around to see that same teacher behind me and I just knew he was doing the same thing I ran to the bathroom in shock I told my head of form yet he did nothing.A [date omitted to preserve anonymity] my pe teacher came into the changing rooms whilst I was only in my bra and others with only a bra and underwear on I was uncomfortable but I let it go as I knew nothing would happend later in the lesson we was playing tennis and as my skirt was my old one as I couldn't find my normal one the ball was on the floor and as I picked it up when I looked up I saw my teacher who was obviously looking down there look back up and smile at me it was so horrific.

Another time I felt uncomfortable was when I was in year six and my ""boyfriend"" at the time who was a few months younger than me, we went to the river near my house and we was alone and we was playing tag in the water except when he was tag he started touching me in my private parts multiple times I told him to stop but he didn't get pulled me close to him and started to touch me but much more I started to cry but he didn't stop I tried to pull back and as soon as I did I ran home and I fell to the floor.

"I was six years old when I was first subjected to a form of assault by a family member. That person and I were playing a game. But then I accidentally fell so then they took that chance, pressed up against me, then proceeded to kiss me and touch me inappropriately. After that incident, they never touched me again. I thought this thing was normal and I basically almost did the same thing to my childhood best friend, but luckily they were smarter than me and said no.Then another few incidents happened when i was seven. My aunt had an in-house worker for 3years and all those years a was a victim of several assaults from them. Every time i met up or got babysat by said person I would get locked up in a room, they would make me straddle them and touch them. Then, [date omitted to preserve anonymity] after my 10th birthday, they resigned and went completely off radar. There was no hope for me.By the time i was 11 i survived different assaults from 4 people. some were related to me. Now, these [date omitted to preserve anonymity] have been oddly difficult. I finally told my mom about what happened to me and i felt at peace for the first day. But then a series of sexual harassment and catcalling started to unfold, and i have never ever felt so distraught.

Climed into my bedroom once and he was waiting for a bus so i was js cleaning my room up while he was sitting on my bed and i turned around and he was wanking, all i could remember was him then forcing me to give him head, i never said yes to things but in a way i didnt know how to say no so i never know if it counts as assult and it keeps me up all night just thinking if it was my fault, the police got involved and now i regret it all so much because they say i asked for it or it looked like i wanted it. They dont believe me at all and they say i ruined his life. The school did nothing about it but give me a hard time by making me right statments and talk to them about it, i wore his hoodie around school and thats when they started calling me obsessed. I cant go anywhere without getting reminded of the things he did to me.

"I was raped continuously throughout my 5 years at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] first school in [location omitted to preserve anonymity]. There was only one male teacher present at the school at the time and he seemed very nice and friendly, clearly not. He was a pedophile who unfortunately never got caught for his actions and moved away when he ran out of people to abuse.
Noone at the school believed me when I told them about what he was doing because I was so young ( aged 5 - 9 years old ) and told me that I was just being silly and that he was ""helping"" as he was one of the only people at the school trained in first aid and he didn't teach any subjects, so he took the opportunity to whenever a child came in, rape them and say that it was helping. 
[organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] was such an amazing school when I went but eversince it has become a horrible school. I really hope that by adding it to the list people can see the damage that happens when they don't listen to children because they ""don't know what they are talking about and are to young to understand"""
I am 13 years old and I was out with my mates and I bummed into this guy we started talking and he seemed really nice he asked for my snap so I gave it him and we got closer until we started dating the first 3 months we’re amazing he treated me so well and it felt like I was worth something but then form the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] we started to argue everyday to the point where he would beat me and the arguments were mostly over the fact that I didn’t want to have sex with him he kept saying things like it’s all fine. Everyone does it and so on but I just kept replying saying I don’t want to just yet we haven’t been together long and I’m still really young and he used to get so ma diver it I just have in but then over time it just happens every single day and it was so draining he wouldn’t let me go out I had to be with him 2[date omitted to preserve anonymity]/7 and all he wanted was sex all the time and it got to paint where I told him I don’t want to anymore and one day he got so mad at it to the point where he grabbed me and choked me shouting your going to do what I say end of and he raped me. I still stayed with him for 4 months after that happened and I still saw him very say becuse whenever u tried to get away or break up with him he wouldn’t let me he would threaten me saying stuff like he was gunna kms if I left or he was gunna come to my house and I didn’t wanna be responsible for that he once sent me a video of him hanging himself to force me to get back with him and every time I gave in and I didn’t wanna tell anyone becuse I felt like they wouldn’t believe me but in the end I told my best mate and she took my phone and messaged him saying we’re over then blcoked him on every thing so he couldn’t message me but I was always in fear of the fact he would find a way to get in contact with me it’s been 3 months now since I broke up with him and I’m in many counciling sessions with people and it is helping me and this one teacher from my school have also reported him to police but they said they can’t do much becuse he’s a minor but he lives across the road from my school and he’s mates with alot of people in my school it’s terrifying when u see him outside waiting for them my heart drops every time I hate it and my school won’t tell him to leave or get off the site even tho they know everything that happens vacua’s he told everyone I was lying so I had to explain it to loads of people and he still won’t go away 
"When I was a first year at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity], I lived in the infamous [location omitted to preserve anonymity] and honestly I loved it. I was always a party girl and this new found freedom was magical to me. I had just got out of a relationship and I was on tinder a lot and I met up with a guy in my student accommodation let’s call him D, we had consensual sex a good few times at halloween time and after that we didn’t speak and honestly I had moved on with my life. After a while I noticed a lot of red flags in him and I just generally lost interest. When I got back from the christmas holidays I started buying weed from him and therefore out of necessity we’d talk occasionally (nothing flirty or even that friendly just civil). In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he invited himself to an afters at my house at which I was very drunk, once the majority of people had gone home he was begging me to stay at mine “because his friends was sleeping in his bed” after saying no multiple times I eventually gave in under the understanding I just wanted to go to sleep. However once he got into my bed he wouldn’t leave me alone, grinding up against me and kissing my neck despite my protests. He then said he wouldn’t let me sleep till I’d had sex with him. This guy was a 6ft very big guy, and I mean weightlifter kinda build, I am fairly tall (5ft 8 ish) but at the time was only 62kg so I knew I couldn’t do anything to stop him. I kept saying no but he wouldn’t take it for an answer, he had raped me in my own bed and I question whether it was rape because I let it happen I guess but it was easier than fighting with him. I begged him to use a condom and not to cum in me but he listened to neither, I am greatful I never got pregnant/ an STD. But I cried for the entire day after and for months I felt so uncomfortable during sex. My body felt dirty and I have never felt so much like a slut, idk the fun stopped when I realised I didn’t even really have control over my own body anymore, I can’t even describe how worthless that made me feel. I think universities should make more of an effort to protect young students in halls because I know so many people who have been raped in those halls, it is up to [location omitted to preserve anonymity] uni to step up. "
"This will be a long story so I am sorry but I also thank you for taking the time to read this, in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] when I first joined my new secondary I had no friends and was just getting by (this was my first week in the school) I was lost in the corridor’s and a boy came up to me and asked if I were okay I explained I was lost so he took me to my class I thanked him, the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he had found me again and asked if I wanted to join him for lunch I accepted and sat with him doing science work in one of the class rooms with a teacher, we got talking and he was in the year above me in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] the teacher had left and he had asked me to truant my next class I was skeptical but I wanted to make a new friend so after some persuasion I agreed, he took me into one of the bathrooms and locked the door (god knows why I agreed to that but I regret it) he took my phone from me and held it in the air and said “take your top off then you can have it back” I refused and tried to grab it but he pushed me away and threatened to drop it into the toilet so I tried grabbing it again and that’s when he grabbed me and started touching up my bum and saying how nice it was then he started to pull on my trousers button so I started to cry and I kicked him and he fell to the floor so I grabbed my bag and my phone and ran out of the bathroom the cameras outside the bathroom caught me running away with my trousers half down and with him chasing me begging me not to tell anyone I agreed and said i wouldn’t just to get him off my back. I walked into my classroom a mess and asked if I could talk to my teacher I had told her I needed to see the head and she agreed, police came to my house and questioned me and they gathered the cctv and my statement and he was expelled from the school only to come in for his GCSEs. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I was getting ready to go to an apprenticeship interview and there I saw him in the entrance to the school he had seen me and he had made a “I will kill you” remark and I lost it I ran to my teacher having a panic attack and because of that I couldn’t go to my interview. Thankfully I have left now and I will never see that monster again. "

"My last relationship was physically abusive. I’m quite mentally ill and they used this against me a lot. A lot of the time it would be ‘i’ll be quick’ or ‘you owe me it’ or ‘come on i know you want to’ kind of thing throughout. Then it came to it where they were telling me that if i don’t have sex with them they’ll tell authorities everything that i’ve done, probably resulting in me being in a hospital, so i was terrified of them and they raped me and i still get flashbacks when im not distracted. it just kind of creeps up on me. they made me lose all my friends and family and when i asked to leave the relationship they started a physical fight with me. Since, i have left the relationship but it still comes back in my mind everyday and i wish i left the relationship at the warning signs. anyway, thank you for reading if you did. sharing has taken a little weight off my shoulders  "
"This girl sexually harassed me on the [location omitted to preserve anonymity] staircase on my way to [location omitted to preserve anonymity] last period, no one cared nor believed me, not even my own friends, no one but myself. She spread rumours saying I was lying so I had  a breakdown and told my parents, nothing has been resolved to this day, the school lie about how they help us."
"I was raped a while ago by a man a few years older than me, he held me captive in my university accommodation and forced me to perform degrading acts on him. All the while he was extremely aggressive and continually choked me, telling me that I better be a ""good girl"" for him or he'll hurt me badly. One key phrase also stuck in my mind, as he remarked that ""it's so cute how weak you are"" when he was raping me. I feel so ashamed having done what he said, and since then there have been multiple incidents of sexual assault from other men in moments when I least expect it.  I can't seem to recover or trust men because every time I begin to feel confident in myself and my sexuality, someone takes away my autonomy in a brief moment with a gesture or action and I'm back to feeling helpless and ashamed. I don't want to feel weak but I've realised that I am in comparison to most men, if and when they'd like they can overpower me and I'll have no control over my own body and actions. I live in constant paranoia and fear of this. "

I was sa by a boy at my primary school
I was walking in the corridor by myself and a sixth former pulled down my tights and grabbed my bum and started squishing it for what felt like an eternity 
"APRIL 20, 2023, IRELAND"
I was touched by 3 teachers 
"I was raped by a boy there and he sexually assaulted me multiple times and all they told him to do was not to do it. Fucking bullshit. Another boy is one of my exes and he keeps doing really sexual shit w me and kissing me and touching me. IN PUBLIC. He knows about my eating disorder and he said to me ""I'm going to kiss u and I hope it gives u the calories I just ate"" it wouldnt but it still was shit on me because it was like he didnt care at all. I had a forced relationship with another lad and he tried to kiss me multiple times in public. One boy in my classes, every single one who I see all day every day repeatedly asks if I cut myself which he knows I do and in front of groups of people he will say stuff like ""go slit ur wrists I hope u die"" and ""wrist reveal"" and ""do u cut urself"" and fucks sake it's so fucking annoying"
"When I was in kindergarten there was a group of 3 children (boys) who liked to go around and put their hands under girls skirts and tickle you there. We were allaround 3 to 4 years old. I remember that I used to go to class in summer just wearing the apron of the uniform, which was basically as a dress, as it was too hot. Since this started happening I didn't want to do it anymore and didn't want to put skirts neither.
I also remember that one day I entered the little wooden house we had in the garden and I saw the same 3 children and another girl of my age. My memory is vague at this point but I think they were undressing her and at some point somebody told a teacher that came and interrupted.

Luckily this didn't affect me much, I barely recall it and I recall I was mainly annoied by these ""stupid guys"". But now that I am an adult it makes me wonder what made them come up with this, were they abused?"

"I had a really bad day at school and i was extremely upset and exhausted and i had been crying and all my makeup and mascara was ruined so i felt very insecure and i had found out i had an hour’s detention [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and i tried to get out of it but they wouldnt let me but they did let me sit in the homework club room so i wouldnt have to see anybody i knew bc i said id felt insecure. Whilst i started doing homework in my detention a year [date omitted to preserve anonymity] boy came and sat next to me (im in year 9) he started talking to me and asking questions like “have you ever done anything your parents dont know about” and complimenting me over and over, i told him to be quiet because it started to annoy me and then i turned and looked at him and he was sat there playing with himself, he told me he had been doing it for 10 minutes and i told hom to stop and got up and left, as soon as i got out the room i told my head of year and since then nothing has been done, i still see him and despite my dad going into the school to talk about it hes still very much there and isnt going anywhere."
"I was 10 years old when this happened. It was break time, him and I were playing along with our mutual friend. We were roleplaying minecraft and the mutual ans I were leaning against a wall pretending to be asleep. I told him to not to anything whilst we were 'sleeping', taking into consideration that we were playing pretend. Nothing happened for a minute until I felt him touching my crotch. I immediately started laughing because I didnt know what he was doing and what actually happened. I joked about telling a teacher, but told him to not do it again since he was getting scared. Later at lunch, I don't remember this clearly, but he did it again and I told a dinner lady and she took me to the headteachers office. He just got told off and nothing else happened to him, but I still remember it everytime I see his face at school, it's almost been 8 years and I hate that it just got dismissed as him just being a boy and me not being taken seriously because I'm a girl. I would say I dont blame him since we were children, but the fact that he did it twice and he's a perverted person [date omitted to preserve anonymity] is what makes me not take his age into consideration."
"hi, i am a boy , 13 and in year 8 at [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity], most of the time in p.e the other boys grab my buldge or make sexual comments which make me quite uncomfortable."
"I was about 7 when I was first sexually abused. My parents had separated and I was with my dad at the weekend. He had a job to do at his cousin's house, and I was left to play with her secondary-school age son. At some point he convinced me to climb under his bed and help him with his homework. He then put a thermometer inside my vagina. I don't recall much about it, but know that he told me it should be a secret. 
The second instance was during my early teens, my second year of secondary school. 
I used to get off the bus at my grans house and stay with her until my mum got home. I would usually either go and sit in the kitchen or front room and watch telly. I don't remember the details of how it came about but I think it started that I'd always go and give my grandad a kiss on the cheek as a greeting when I came in, and he must have turned his face towards me one day. Eventually, it became that I would sit next to him on the sofa and he would kiss me inappropriately for minutes at a time. I don't remember when or why it stopped, but I just remember being glad it had. I felt so confused, was he cheating on my gran? I was only 12. I let both of these memories pass in to the distant memories of my early life as I had clearly decided to not report the behaviours so couldn't see any point in hashing it up in my mind. 
I didn't realise that I should have sought help for the mental repercussions, as I feel these two instances are the reason that I spent my teenage years putting myself in increasingly dangerous situations and having sex with strangers, being taken advantage of and being abused by men who took my lack of no to be a yes. 
I am now a stable, settled 30 year old and am married with two children and my husband is the kindest, most respectful and caring man you could meet. I am one of the lucky ones. Keep fighting everybody, and know that you can overcome what has been done to you. "
"I was 14 years old. I had to sit next to this boy for the whole year in admin and I knew I couldn’t do anything about it or tell anybody because none of the teachers cared or would listen. I knew nobody would do anything about it so I just had to sit there and take it. I hated it, I hated him."
"I use to go to this school I moved. It was a mixed school and I am a female, the uniform would be a jumper and really what ever bottoms. It was sunny pe day and I wore leggings. I was a third year at the time. I was walking in the morning when I felt the worse slap on my ass by a second year boy looking at me with a disgusting stare. He said oh I wish your top half looked as good as your bottom half. I was in disbelief so I walked away and scoffed. Not interested he noticed and said well you’re a fat bitch anyway. "
"If you are reading this thank you.
I'll start by stating when this happened, I roughly remember my experience happened [date omitted to preserve anonymity] or [date omitted to preserve anonymity] i was in primary and it started when I was is in year 2 it continued until year 5. I had a classmate and anytime he sat next to me he would always touch my thigh and sometimes even put his hands down my pants and touch my private part, I felt disgusting I never told any[date omitted to preserve anonymity] because I always felt like I was going to be judged by the people around me at the time and I wasn't aware of what he was doing to me I was 7 or 8 at the time. He would also make me touch his penis because he wanted to feel 'excited' I always did what he asked me to do because I was scared of him, at the time he would hit me and punch me if I didn't listen to him. I would always arrive home with bruises on my arms my parents would ask me why i had bruises but I always lied to them by telling them I 'fell off' the swings. the touching got so bad over the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he would sometimes finger me and tell me I felt 'nice' I would go home crying because I felt stupid for letting him do that, one day I went to school in a skirt and I sat next to him in class for our last lesson I had one of my girl classmates sit next to me so I could feel comfortable at that time she didn't know why I felt comfortable around her, it was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] before lesson ended the classmate next to me dropped her ruler so the guy obviously took advantage and went to 'pick' it up I was sitting there right in front of the ruler and he grabbed it and pushed the ruler right in between my legs I jolted out of my chair and told him I had enough he was begging me not to tell the teacher but I felt like I needed to do something so I went to the teacher and told her. She was furious with what I told her she immediately went up to him and pulled him out of class (she pulled me out of class as well) she asked me how long this was going on for and I told her 3 years she didn't hear his side of the story because she saw how I acted around him when he was near me. after minutes of waiting my mum got called and so did his the police got involved as well, in the end he got removed from school for 1 month and I got therapy for the rest of my school year. the feeling of him touching me is still engraved in my head and I cant get rid of it.

"This is about my first proper boyfriend. He lived about an hour away so to see him I would have to get a bus or train as neither of us had our license. He was pretty much my first everything. The first few times we had sex was entirely on my terms, he had done it before and so was okay with it. About two months into the relationship he started wanting to have sex a lot more. Every time I saw him the first thing he would try and do was have sex. Even if I was on my period or not in the mood. It got to the point where I never wanted to have sex, but he would always talk me into it. He would spend ages - up to 40 minutes one time - trying to get me to say yes. I always would, but that was because I was scared about how he would react if I carried on saying no. For four months of our relationship we only had fully consensual sex once. I started to think that was all he wanted from me, he wouldn't talk to me much during the day and then we were both back from school the conversations would always turn sexual, constantly asking for nudes and especially at night. He once held me by my neck during sex after I had continuously said I didn't want him to. I broke up with after six months. Right now, I am conflicted. I cant tell if what I experienced was sexual assault or not, because I would always say yes in the, even if I didn't want to and always after he would spend ages pressuring me into it. "
I was well um i was sexually assulted and rapes when i had ran away from home it has been almost a year and i still dont like talking about it or even like mentioning it but after i got comments in school like you have a nice ass or your lying or have you had sex or where did you go for too weeks or did you shag you bf i even got told once that me and my brother were having sex school wwas a bad experiance for me but this time [date omitted to preserve anonymity] was even worse
"The girls within my unit have constantly been harassed both sexually and otherwise by both male cadets and male members of staff throughout my time in the unit. From sexual conquest lists to being treated like objects of sexual desires we have faced many obstacles throughout. 
When reported to the staff the biggest consequence given was a verbal warning. Even though we all sat through a briefing at the start of the university year about how sexual harassment was not tolerated in the navy and that it would be instant dismissal. The staff wonder why we don't take welfare issues to them, but how can we if we don't feel like our voices can be heard. One incidence [date omitted to preserve anonymity] a major perpetrator of the sexual harassment was promoted into a position of leadership. One of the very people we are meant to go to when we have an issue. The staff even found what he did funny, Our commanding officer even referring to his sexual conquest list as his ""ultimate orgy list"". 
A member of staff once made me feel as though I hadn't earned my place in my unit fairly and suggested that my bruises were not from an obstacle course that I had just done but because I had a boyfriend. Repeatedly making comments similar to this even once I had made it clear that it was making me uncomfortable. 
I have faced multiple sexual harassment comments made by people who have previously been on verbal warnings. Proving that the welfare system doesn't work but when asked if we could change the system the staff close themselves off to protect themselves. The whole issue is perpetuated by the boys club in the leadership team. They just want to protect themselves. When it came out that a large percentage of the girls in the unit were unhappy and had complained we all received messages from the boys about how they felt they had done nothing wrong and why hadn't we told them before. When we had all tried on so many occasions. The fact that the person in charge of welfare [date omitted to preserve anonymity] was part of the 'boys club' only made the issue worse. 
The issue led to the involvement of one of the most senior officers involved in the organisation where their suggestion was to only give verbal warnings. Even though this contradicts all of the policies that the navy has. No action has been taken against the staff member that complaints were made against, not even a recognition of an email that was sent to the commanding officer where the staff member was named. It has all been hidden away in an attempt to protect careers above the welfare of the female cadets.

"APRIL 18, 2023, UNITED KINGDOM"
a boy from year 13 at [location omitted to preserve anonymity] school in [location omitted to preserve anonymity] sexually assaulted me when I was very drunk. it was a one time fling that was terrifying. since then I have heard a number of varying allegations which have come from this same boy. no one has done anything. he has completely ruined my confidence and self esteem and I truly wish I was brave enough to tell someone.
"I was emotionally, financially and physically vulnerable at the time - at 15 my father had been jailed, our house, money and belongings repossessed and trying to carry on with education and life while hiding this situation from the small middle class white community we lived in and already felt alienated from. My mother who had not worked for +20yrs was also found guilty in the court case, while doing her court ordered community service hours she struggled to get a paid job to help provide for the household, claiming benefits and always counting her pennies; we were all trying our best to make ends meet and build a stable life again. At the time, I aspired to be a doctor just like some of the richest and smartest family members I had, and so pursued as much work experience and volunteering as I could. I joined a local disabled charity, one that ran weekly activities and summer camps for disabled children. All the volunteers were around my age and up to mid 20s, with the managers being from mid 20s to 40s. I was successful in the interview process and was onboarded into an establishment I could not have imagined existed given it is a charity with a mission to provide life-long support to the local disabled community. 

There was a clear position of power for the managers and leaders in their mid 20s, both directly and indirectly - in working conditions they were the boss, in social positions they would openly discuss the female volunteers sexually and compare us. On numerous occasions, 3 of the leaders leveraged settings like 1:1 car shares, 1:1 tasks that were away from the group, and after-work drinks to sexually harass and eventually sexually assault me which is the story I want to share.

One of the leaders had been giving me a lot of attention - one on one I would receive flattery, kind words, sometimes tasteful jokes, but in group settings would find ways to make me feel small, weak and ugly amongst the other volunteers. Without realising, I was being groomed to yearn for his validation and make him happy; this went on 5days a week for 2months. Nearing the end of the summer camp, us volunteers and leaders were helping prepare the charity building for renovation - clearing out items and putting rubbish in skips, I was 16 and couldn't drive, so as per his information, I told my mother to pick me up at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. As [date omitted to preserve anonymity] approached, the volunteers and leaders started grabbing their belongings and said their goodbyes, I called out to one of the leaders and said ""where's everyone going? [name omitted to preserve anonymity] told me we're finishing at [date omitted to preserve anonymity]"". That leader laughed and said ""no, we finish at [date omitted to preserve anonymity] but maybe he has something for you to do"", gave a smirk to two of the older boys and left with everyone. I wanted to text my mother to tell her to pick me up as soon as she can, it was only me and [name omitted to preserve anonymity] in the building, but he told me not to, gave me comforting words that he just wanted to spend some time with me without everyone getting in the way. He began touching my body. He described what he loved about my body, how he found me attractive and how much he liked me and began kissing my neck and then my lips, and pulled me into, what was, the soft play area. I said to him I felt uncomfortable, I felt weird and told him we should leave, it's weird and wrong to be doing this and asked him to stop. He used his winning tactic; he started demeaning me, compared me to the other women, and said in summary that he would humiliate me if I didn't put out. He started removing my clothes, I felt stuck. I was so groomed into doing what he wished. He removed his clothes and started touching himself, groping my body and muttering what he wanted to do to me. I was on my period and I was both scared he would see my pad and use that to humiliate me, but also hoped it would be a way to stop him. It didn't, he brought me to the floor, now on top of me, pinning me down, grinding on me and moaning, forcing his fingers inside me and then his dick and took my virginity. In a minute he finished inside me. My jeans were stained with both fresh blood and my period and I was in pain, was spacey and mute. He got dressed, and held me, comforted me. And told me to ask my mum to come pick me up. We waited in silence while he scrolled his phone walking in and out of the room. When my mum arrived I went out to her car and he went to his and we went our separate ways. I never shared this with my family.

This was the beginning of a coercive relationship that spanned 2yrs. He would take pictures of me naked, post them on [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] and threaten to share it with others if I didn't perform sexual acts on him. I was weak and let him have access to my body when he wanted and how he wanted. When I confided in a fellow female volunteer, the conversation was dismissed, she told me she was already aware that I was sleeping with [name omitted to preserve anonymity], ""everyone has had their time with [name omitted to preserve anonymity]"", he'd already been sleeping with her friends and even herself. She would flirt with him at work drinks, and resent when the boys would discuss the acts he would do to me. It was entertainment, and it became a competition of which girl is best in the sack. A new female volunteer joined, 16yo at the time, and she was the new girl he pursued, he would send me naked photos of her and ask me why I didn't have an amazing body like hers, he would describe how much better she was in bed, he shared his [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] account that had hundreds of faceless nudes of other women he had fucked including her and me. And that day was when I realised I was part of his sick game. 

Even to this day I blame myself for being a part of this, for allowing him access to my body, and it's taken 10yrs and discussions in therapy to understand that what I experienced was sexual coercion, and I was targeted for my vulnerability. The charity community was in fact culpable, as I heard in our community socials, managers in their 40s would find entertainment in discussing the sexual acts these boys were doing to female volunteers. Even the father of one of the boys who was chairman of the charity would find these stories entertaining and high five the boys.

Blurred lines and my not-so-aggressive approach to saying ""no"" was what made me feel like I am the one to blame. It destroyed my sense of self-worth, regularly considering suicide between 17 and 18yrs old, and even attempting at a nearby railway line near my house. 

I am grateful I have grown a thicker skin, I am grateful I have confidence to leave situations I don't feel comfortable and call out sexually coercive behaviour - but learning the hard way affected my youth and the healing process was painful. I was hiding a dark and painful life for years, I certainly didn't need it while my family and I were, and still are, rebuilding our lives after my fathers conviction and the subsequent repossession, and it didn't serve any good to my education."
"I am in my 30s now but I have come to realise that I was sexually exploited as a teenager by my peers. I had never got into any trouble or had any real issues until I was [date omitted to preserve anonymity] [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. Around this age I started to self sabotage - drinking, smoking, skipping school, just not really caring about things. I can see now in hindsight that this was linked to unresolved issues around loss and death, but at the age of [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I didn't know why I was doing what I was doing and I just felt angry at the world. This time coincided with becoming romantically/sexually involved with boys from school but as the drinking increased, my power and control over my decisions diminished. I ended up with a reputation as a girl who would do sexual acts and boys would capitalise on that - waiting for me to be drunk and then getting me to do things when I could barely stand. As a young person I thought I had control and choice over this, and in some instances I still think I did but there was a whole bunch of situations where I can now see I was sexually assaulted. There were some times that I don't remember, or that I do remember parts of, and distinctly remember not wanting to do things and saying no, but they still happened. It was only recently that I saw one man who I went to school with, who I have not seen since leaving school, that it really hit me. I felt physically sick seeing him. I was dragged straight back to being 15 in a woodland to an experience I had not thought of in 20 years. It was then I started to think about other situations and other boys. I wonder if the boys think about it in the same way, or whether they still think of me as a drunk girl, a sure thing, as someone who is consenting through their actions of being too drunk to say no, consenting through their reputation. I started to think about the fact that the staff at the school must have known what was going on - I know they did as one particularly awful teacher commented on me being 'promiscuous' in a class once. I have gone on to have a very sucessful career where I support people, some of whom have experienced sexual abuse. Yet the realisation that I too was a victim or survivor (depending on what language you use) never hit me until very recently and I think it is now something I need to work through for myself. For anyone reading this, if you see yourself or someone you know in this story - speak up. "
"I was living with my boyfriend, who I felt like didn't find me attractive anymore, and wasn't putting a lot of effort into our relationship. I cheated on him with someone from my work, which is something I regret more than anything. I told the guy from my work that I wasn't ready to do anything sexual. I fell asleep at his house after a long night, and when I woke up, my pants were off and he was fingering me, while grinding up against my side. I told him to stop, and it wasn't until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] that he did. I flipped over and felt myself disassociating, to which he responded ""you feel this upset because you know we are meant to be together. If our relationship didn't mean this much to you, you wouldn't be this upset."" I stayed with him for 6 more months, and it wasn't until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] in my next relationship that I had realized that it was assault. I am still coming to terms with it. "
There is this boy in most of my classes I'll call him L this happened recently and the school hasn't done anything about it and I'm scared he will do it again so he sexually touched me really hard and forcefully once when he was about to leave the class and the second time he has done it was in pe I bent over to get the basketball for him like being nice this was before the other thing happened and he grabbed my hips and humped me I'm really scared of men and boys cause of this so I wanted to share my story cause none of my classmates believe me that he done it and even his best mate said he didn't do it and I'm just so pissed the school isn't doing anything about it.

"This is a long read so if you do choose to read it, thank you.
I don’t know if this story counts because I wasn’t physically assaulted but I’ve always been cautious around a certain family member of mine and have recently been told some horrific things about them. When I was about 14 I had an ‘outing’ with said family member that lasted a whole day and we were alone all day. 
It was about thirty degrees so I was in shorts and a vest top. Not long into the day he started asking me inappropriate questions like ‘have you had sex?’  Then when I said no he listed sexual acts and asked me if i had done any of them. I replied with no to every question of course. He then proceeded to ask me about what sexual things friends my age have done and asking me to go into detail. I replied with ‘I don’t know’ and made it clear i was uncomfortable with the situation but this didn’t stop him. 
Im putting this on here to raise awareness because this was supposed to be someone I feel safe with. A blood relative who watched me grow for 14 years. A person I used to cuddle and tell them I loved them. That day has been haunting me ever since and I can’t help thinking that if my answer wasn’t no when they asked if I had sex then maybe they would had assaulted me. 
I told my mum [date omitted to preserve anonymity] because we were going to be seeing this particular person soon. I begged her not to tell my dad in fear of what he would do to them. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I told my dad. 
It come out to the whole family in [date omitted to preserve anonymity] and they have not attended any family events since and have been cut off by some family because of it. Although I wasn’t physically assaulted (by this person anyway) it haunts me more than the times I have been.
Every time I think about it I feel sick. No one talks about it. No one has addressed it to me at all since it came out, not him or his wife or any of his kids. It’s just life as normal like it never happened. But it did happen and it has traumatised me."

"A person that i knew assaulted me quite a few times. Once i was in lesson and they were sat next to me and went inside of my skirt and started touching me. I was too scared to say anything because we were in a full class and to come out and say anything would’ve been weird and embarrassing. There was another time where they started doing something and i said stop but they didn’t, this resulted in me fainting and people not knowing where i was. All in all nothing was done about this despite people knowing and their abuse being exposed by myself."

"I was raped by a boy a couple years younger than me back in [date omitted to preserve anonymity]. I was in sixth form. It began as consensual but I took away consent and he didn’t listen. My family don’t believe me, and say it’s “not proper rape”. I don’t care if he sees this, I want him to know how much of a disgusting person I think he is. I know you told everybody it was consensual. But was it consensual? When I pleaded, crying and begging for you to stop? When I had to start hitting you? Was it consensual when [date omitted to preserve anonymity] after it happened you came outside of my house and posted pictures of my house on [organisation omitted to preserve anonymity] threatening to kidnap me? 

There’s a reason I had to go off the till when you came into the store. Because you killed what was left of me as a person those days. 

I hope you rot."

"I stayed in student accommodation at this University, I was so excited and happy to finally be out on my own for the first time. I was older than most other people in my accommodation who were mainly 17 and 18 however I thought “this is it! This is the start of the rest of my life”. There I met someone in the accommodation and over the course of the 9 months he repeatedly subjected to me to sexual violence. He wouldn’t listen. I didn’t realise what was happening at the time. It still breaks my heart to this day. No was never an option. I now have to live with the torment I faced there and I have to try and cope with it, deal with it and process it. He’s broken me however I will not be forever broken, I am a survivor, not a victim!  "
"When I was 17 I was assaulted by someone I thought I could trust. He was someone I liked, someone I thought respected me, someone I never expected to treat me the way he did. 
It’s taken me till now to be able to say the word assault out loud, and to begin to get over the effect he’s had on me. It’s taken me till now to speak about it to someone professional, to tell the story, and attempt to stop the embarrassment I’ve felt ever since. It’s a nasty recovery but I’m so happy I’ve started it. I deserve to get over it. "

"In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I got moved seats next to this really awfully behaved boy to ‘set a good example’ or something. He immediately started bullying me and it got physical regularly. He slapped me round the face and I wasn’t believed because there wasn’t a bruise.

In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] I had to sit next to him in a different lesson, again to set a good example. He started showing me and another girl porn. He also groped me a few times. He tried sitting on my lap and falsely accused me of assaulting him because I pushed him off.

In [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he airdropped me a photo of his penis in class. I tried telling the teacher at the time and got told off for having my phone out. The boy and his friends kept telling me about how disgusting I was for seeing the photo and how much trouble I would get in. I believed them. I didn’t tell anyone for a year.

Midway through [date omitted to preserve anonymity] we had a huge argument that led to me telling on him for everything. By that point it couldn’t be dealt with because it was ‘historic’. He told everyone that I’m a snitch and carried on bullying and harassing me until he got expelled from school for an unrelated reason."
"I was in an after school detention and a boy in my year was shouting sexual things across the room at me. He moved seats and sat next to me and would not leave me alone. It ended with him grabbing my breast, ‘hugging’ me round the chest really hard and squeezing me. There were 3 teachers in the room who didn’t notice.

[date omitted to preserve anonymity] he did something similar to me, also in an after school detention. I got blamed for it because the detentions themselves were my fault."
"The first time I was assaulted was backstage in a theatre by a co-actor during a theatre camp the summer I turned 15. He was 21. Because of him, I formed an eating disorder right as I was hitting puberty. I would refuse to eat until I couldn't recognize myself until I was no longer the girl he saw and liked so much. I have always wanted to be an actor, and the fact that it was backstage at a theatre was devastating for me. I remember I was learning to drive and once I started driving alone, I would have panic attacks while driving on the freeway because I would see his face in the backseat. I would have to pull over and convince myself he wasn't actually there. It took me most of high school to work through that experience. I finally was getting much better and truly not thinking about him and I felt confident in myself at college, I overcame my eating disorder and I was comfortable in myself. 
Then, in [date omitted to preserve anonymity], the beginning of my sophomore year of college, I went out to a bar with some of my friends, I wasn't that drunk and my roommate started dancing with this guy. I'm gay and only like women but sometimes it's fun to just fuck around at bars, especially bars that mostly just have straight men and women. So I started dancing with the guy's friend. My roommate and I were dancing next to each other with these guys. And the guy I was dancing with somehow pulled us away from my friends and my roommate and raped me in the corner of the bar. It was so crowded no one could see us, my friends had no clue where I went and I didn't know where they were. I'm not sure how long it lasted, but I was just trying to lock eyes with someone I knew. Finally, one of my friends saw me and pulled me further into the dance floor. I didn't report it because I didn't even know the guy's name, I would not be able to identify him if he was right in front of me. That experience set me into the deepest depression I have ever been in in my life. I was showing signs of alcoholism because of it, coming home every night from classes and drinking half a bottle or a full bottle of wine by myself. I was actively suicidal and almost attempted on two different occasions. But now, [date omitted to preserve anonymity], I finally feel like I am in a good place, I still can't go to that bar but I feel confident in myself, and my sexuality, and I don't feel like it was my fault anymore. And it is still hard because I feel like these things will never go away. And sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I had tried to report it. But I am so proud of myself for how far I've come and I am so proud of the person I've become and how I was able to pick myself back up and try to love living again. "

"In my 7th and 8th grade years I was raped multiple time by my boyfriend of 2ish years at the time. He was two grades above me. Every time he was drunk and one of the times I was as well. We continued to date for another year and the sexual and physical abuse continued. The last time I became pregnant but shortly after finding out and telling him, we got into a fight and he started hitting and throwing things at me and then hit me in the stomach causing a miscarriage. A [date omitted to preserve anonymity] after this he ended things to get together with another girl. Now i’m in my freshmen year and he goes to my school. [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he came up to me and apologized for everything he’d done but then [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he raped me in the gym at our school. "

"i was raped and when people found out, his gf and her friend said they were gonna beat me up at school for ""lying"" even though i wasn't. they said all sorts of horrible shit to me like ""no one believes you"" ""no one needs you, not even your mum, that's why she abuses you"" and so instead of going to school the next say i just walked around until the police messaged me so i walked to the police station and said how i got raped and that i didn't want to go to school because the teachers already knew and didn't do anything about it.

I have been touched up multiple times by students in busy corridors with having my chest groped purposefully and well as having my butt grabbed more than once.

"I was living and studying abroad and one evening was invited to come out for drinks and a dj set. I didn’t know these people well and felt uncomfortable but I just kept dancing and drinking. At the end one boy and I went to the Metro as we were going in the same direction. On the train, he started touching my thigh, and put his hand under my skirt. I moved away and he became more aggressive until I ran off the train. It was the last train of the evening and I was nowhere near home. Very much drunk, I call a friend that lives nearby if I can stay at his. I offer sex, very much not soberly and in the right frame of mind that when I arrive at his apartment I fall onto the bed and can only see the ceiling spinning. I can’t remember much but him telling me “I’m a good person, I know I’m  a really good person”. And then we had sex. Instantly sober again, I felt disgusted, unclean and could only think of how I would have to wait until [date omitted to preserve anonymity] to get the next train home. So I just lay far apart from him, very awake now, in his bed until I could leave. This was one of my closest friends in this new city, so after the incident I really felt like I didn’t have anyone. "

"One of my friends had told me he liked me beforehand but I didn't want a relationship because we were good friends and we go to a lot of the sporting events together. Over the [date omitted to preserve anonymity] he would keep asking me to go out and I didn't want to. I went to a weekend of training for my sport and he was there and after a really fun first day, I was asked to go for a walk alone with him. I agreed and went off with him to chat. he suddenly started acting really odd with me and put my coat down in front of me to pick up. So obviously I went to get it and when I was bent over to pick it up, he pulled down my trousers. I was wearing underwear but it didn't hide anything so I was completely exposed. I was so upset and mad, I tried to push him away but he didn't move and he pulled me in for a hug from behind and said sorry while laughing. I was beside myself. I told him that he just assaulted me but he didn't seem to acknowledge it. We walked off together and he asked me to give him a chance. I had to then go the whole last day of training just replaying it in my head trying to act normal and as if nothing happened in front of all his friends. I let him off for a while because I didn't know what to do. Only just have I been able to tell him exactly how I feel. He seemed sorry at first but quickly changed the conversation. I want to tell his parents but I am worried it's going to cause so much tension everywhere I go with him."

I befriended a boy in year 7 who had a crush on me but I wasn’t Interested. He lost the crush over time and in year 8 he would constantly sexualize me and my friend. He started touching me a lot as a joke and it became a daily thing and in more private areas every time. In his eyes it was a joke but it wasn’t at all. He doesn’t remember it happening.

I was walking down the hall in school and was assaulted by a [date omitted to preserve anonymity] 11 behind me and maybe some of his friends too (I’m not sure). They were all laughing. It was a hall FULL of people and no one saw and if they did they ignored it. My best friend didn’t believe me.
